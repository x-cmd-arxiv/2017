time-series data. Gaussian DyBM is a DyBM that assumes the predicted data is
generated by a Gaussian distribution whose first-order moment (mean)
dynamically changes over time but its second-order moment (variance) is fixed.
However, in many financial applications, the assumption is quite limiting in
two aspects. First, even when the data follows a Gaussian distribution, its
variance may change over time. Such variance is also related to important
temporal economic indicators such as the market volatility. Second, financial
time-series data often requires learning datasets generated by the generalized
Gaussian distribution with an additional shape parameter that is important to
approximate heavy-tailed distributions. Addressing those aspects, we show how
to extend DyBM that results in significant performance improvement in
predicting financial time-series data.

research, uniqueness theorems for potential-field inversion are scarce. Applied
studies successfully improve potential-field inversion results by including
constraints from independent measurements, but so far no mathematical theorem
guarantees that source localization improves the inversion in terms of
uniqueness of the achieved assignment. Empirical inversion techniques therefore
use numerical and statistical approaches to assess the reliability of their
results. Especially when inverting magnetic field surface measurements, even
seemingly advanced mathematical approaches require substantial additional
assumptions about the source magnetization to achieve a useful reconstruction.
Here, standard potential field theory is used to prove a uniqueness theorem
which completely characterizes the mathematical background of source-localized
inversion. It guarantees for an astonishingly large class of source
localizations that it is possible by potential field measurements on a surface
to differentiate between signals from different source regions. Non-uniqueness
of potential field inversion only prevents that the source distribution within
the individual regions can be uniquely recovered.

selected by transforming measured hits to a binned, three- or four-dimensional,
track parameter space. It is accomplished by the use of templates taking
advantage of the translational and rotational symmetries of the detectors.
Track candidates and their corresponding hits, the nodes, form a usually highly
connected network, a bipartite graph, where we allow for multiple hit to track
assignments, edges. The graph is cut into very many minigraphs by removing a
few of its vulnerable components, edged and nodes. Finally the hits are
distributed among the track candidates by exploring a deterministic decision
tree. A depth-limited search is performed maximising the number of hits on
tracks, and minimising the sum of track-fit $\chi^2$. Simplified models of LHC
silicon trackers, as well as the relevant physics processes, are employed to
study the performance (efficiency, purity, timing) of the proposed method in
the case of single or many simultaneous proton-proton collisions (high pileup),

addition, they can opportunistically switch interaction partners to improve
their payoff. Our Monte Carlo simulation showed that a large frequency of
punishers is required to suppress defectors when the frequency of partner
switching is low. In contrast, cooperation is the most abundant strategy when
the frequency of partner switching is high regardless of the strength of
punishment. Interestingly, cooperators become abundant not because they avoid
the cost of inflicting punishment and earn a larger average payoff per game but
rather because they have more numerous opportunities to be referred as a role
agent by defectors. Our results imply that the fluidity of social relationships
has a profound effect on the adopted strategy in maintaining cooperation.

receptors, ranging from chemotactic receptors in bacteria to growth factor and
neurotransmitter receptors in mammalian cells, a mechanistic understanding of
the underlying molecular processes is still puzzling. In an attempt to fill
this gap we followed a combined experimental and theoretical approach by
dissecting and modulating cargo binding, internalization and cellular response
mediated by KDEL receptors (KDELRs) at the mammalian cell surface after
interaction with a model cargo/ligand. Using a fluorescent variant of ricin
toxin A chain as KDELR-ligand, eGFP-RTA (H/KDEL), we demonstrate that cargo
binding induces dose-dependent receptor cluster formation at and subsequent
internalization from the membrane which is associated and counteracted by
anterograde and microtubule-assisted receptor transport to preferred docking
sites at the plasma membrane. By means of analytical arguments and extensive
numerical simulations we show that cargo-synchronized receptor transport from
and to the membrane is causative for KDELR/cargo cluster formation at the
mammalian cell surface.

in their mass-radius relation. In sub-Neptunes most of the planet mass is in
the rocky part (hereafter core) which is surrounded by a modest hydrogen-helium
envelope. As a result, the total initial heat content of such a planet is
dominated by that of the core. Nonetheless, most studies contend that the core
cooling will only have a minor effect on the radius evolution of the gaseous
envelope, because the core's cooling is in sync with the envelope, i.e., most
of the initial heat is released early on timescales of about 10-100 Myr. In
this Letter we examine the importance of the core cooling rate for the thermal
evolution of the envelope. Thus, we relax the early core cooling assumption and
present a model where the core is characterized by two parameters: the initial
temperature and the cooling time. We find that core cooling can significantly
enhance the radius of the planet when it operates on a timescale similar to the
observed age, i.e. several Gyr. Consequently, the interpretation of
sub-Neptunes' mass-radius observations depends on the assumed core thermal
properties and the uncertainty therein. The degeneracy of composition and core
thermal properties can be reduced by obtaining better estimates of the planet
ages (in addition to their radii and masses) as envisioned by future
observations.

resistance following an activated behavior that levels off and saturates below
4K. This behavior can be explained by the proposal of SmB6 representing a new
state of matter, a Topological Kondo insulator, in which a Kondo gap is
developed and topologically protected surface conduction dominates
low-temperature transport. Exploiting its non-linear dynamics, a tunable SmB6
oscillator device was recently demonstrated, where a small DC current generates
large oscillating voltages at frequencies from a few Hz to hundreds of MHz.
This behavior was explained by a theoretical model describing the thermal and
electronic dynamics of coupled surface and bulk states. However, a crucial
aspect of this model, the predicted temperature oscillation in the surface
state, hasn't been experimentally observed to date. This is largely due to the
technical difficulty of detecting an oscillating temperature of the very thin
surface state. Here we report direct measurements of the time-dependent surface
state temperature in SmB6 with a RuO micro-thermometer. Our results agree
quantitatively with the theoretically simulated temperature waveform, and hence
support the validity of the oscillator model, which will provide accurate
theoretical guidance for developing future SmB6oscillators at higher
frequencies.

The potential outcomes framework is a main statistical approach to causal
inference, in which a causal effect is defined as a comparison of the potential
outcomes of the same units under different treatment conditions. Because for
each unit at most one of the potential outcomes is observed and the rest are
missing, causal inference is inherently a missing data problem. Indeed, there
is a close analogy in the terminology and the inferential framework between
causal inference and missing data. Despite the intrinsic connection between the
two subjects, statistical analyses of causal inference and missing data also
have marked differences in aims, settings and methods. This article provides a
systematic review of causal inference from the missing data perspective.
Focusing on ignorable treatment assignment mechanisms, we discuss a wide range
of causal inference methods that have analogues in missing data analysis, such
as imputation, inverse probability weighting and doubly-robust methods. Under
each of the three modes of inference--Frequentist, Bayesian, and Fisherian
randomization--we present the general structure of inference for both

mechanism in coronal loops, capable of delivering energy to both the corona and
chromosphere and giving rise to many observed features, of flaring and
quiescent regions. In previous work, we established that resistive dissipation
of waves (ambipolar diffusion) can drive strong chromospheric heating and
evaporation, capable of producing flaring signatures. However, that model was
based on a simplified assumption that the waves propagate instantly to the
chromosphere, an assumption which the current work removes. Via a ray tracing
method, we have implemented traveling waves in a field-aligned hydrodynamic
simulation that dissipate locally as they propagate along the field line. We
compare this method to and validate against the magnetohydrodynamics code
Lare3D. We then examine the importance of travel times to the dynamics of the
loop evolution, finding that (1) the ionization level of the plasma plays a
critical role in determining the location and rate at which waves dissipate;
(2) long duration waves effectively bore a hole into the chromosphere, allowing
subsequent waves to penetrate deeper than previously expected, unlike an
electron beam whose energy deposition rises in height as evaporation reduces
the mean-free paths of the electrons; (3) the dissipation of these waves drives
a pressure front that propagates to deeper depths, unlike energy deposition by
an electron beam.

volume (FCFV) method. Contrary to the popular vertex (VCFV) and cell (CCFV)
centred finite volume methods, the novel FCFV defines the solution on the mesh
faces (edges in 2D) to construct locally-conservative numerical schemes.
  The idea of the FCFV method stems from a hybridisable discontinuous Galerkin
(HDG) formulation with constant degree of approximation, thus inheriting the
convergence properties of the classical HDG. The resulting FCFV features a
global problem in terms of a piecewise constant function defined on the faces
of the mesh. The solution and its gradient in each element are then recovered
by solving a set of independent element-by-element problems.
  The mathematical formulation of FCFV for Poisson and Stokes equation is
derived and numerical evidence of optimal convergence in 2D and 3D is provided.
Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the accuracy, efficiency and
robustness of the proposed methodology. The results show that, contrary to
other FV methods, the accuracy of the FCFV method is not sensitive to mesh
distortion and stretching. In addition, the FCFV method shows its better
performance, accuracy and robustness using simplicial elements, facilitating
its application to problems involving complex geometries in 3D.

  Study","submitted to an international conference",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are very popular these days, and are the subject
of a very intense investigation. A DNN is made by layers of internal units (or
neurons), each of which computes an affine combination of the output of the
units in the previous layer, applies a nonlinear operator, and outputs the
corresponding value (also known as activation). A commonly-used nonlinear
operator is the so-called rectified linear unit (ReLU), whose output is just
the maximum between its input value and zero. In this (and other similar cases
like max pooling, where the max operation involves more than one input value),
one can model the DNN as a 0-1 Mixed Integer Linear Program (0-1 MILP) where
the continuous variables correspond to the output values of each unit, and a
binary variable is associated with each ReLU to model its yes/no nature. In
this paper we discuss the peculiarity of this kind of 0-1 MILP models, and
describe an effective bound-tightening technique intended to ease its solution.
We also present possible applications of the 0-1 MILP model arising in feature
visualization and in the construction of adversarial examples. Preliminary
computational results are reported, aimed at investigating (on small DNNs) the
computational performance of a state-of-the-art MILP solver when applied to a
known test case, namely, hand-written digit recognition.

modification in the definition of the momentum current in the phase space,
compared to the case in which the system is in global equilibrium. Using this
modified momentum current, we derive the linearized conservation equations from
the kinetic equation up to second order in the derivative expansion. It turns
out that the eigenmodes of these equations, namely the hydrodynamic modes,
differ from those obtained from the hydrodynamic in the Landau-Lifshitz (LL)
frame at the same order. We show that the modes of the former case may be
transformed to the corresponding modes in the latter case by a global boost.
The velocity of the boost is proportional to the magnetic field as well as the
difference between the right- and left-handed charges susceptibility. We then
compute the chiral transport coefficients in a system of non-Abelian chiral

penetration in the near future. With the converter interface, the rotor inertia
of doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) based wind turbine generator is
effectively decoupled from the system, causing a reduction in inertial
response. This can be compensated by enabling the DFIG to provide fast
frequency response. This paper proposes a quantitative control approach for
DFIG to deliver fast frequency response in the inertial response time scale. A
supplementary power surge function is added to the active power reference of
DFIG. The exact amount of power surge that is available from DFIG-based wind
turbine is quantified based on estimation of maximum extractable energy.
Moreover, the operational constraints such as rotor limits and converter
over-load limit are considered at the same time. Thus, the proposed approach
not only provides adequate inertial response but also ensures the rotor speed
is kept within a specified operating range. Rotor safety is guaranteed without
the need for an additional rotor speed protection scheme.

Many extensions of the Standard Model that solve the hierarchy problem result
in new particles. We will study the phenomenology of vector-like fermions
resulting in theories where the Higgs boson is typically a
pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson. In these theories we study the case where a heavy

by assuming that ALPs are emitted by the protoneutron star just before the
core-bounce in Galactic core-collapse supernovae, and that these ALPs
subsequently convert to $\gamma$-ray photons which ought to be detected by a
$\gamma$-ray mission. This argument has been applied to supernova 1987A to
derive the bound on the ALP-photon coupling $g_{a \gamma \gamma} \lesssim 5.3
\cdot 10^{- 12} \, {\rm GeV}^{- 1}$ for an ALP mass $m_a \lesssim 4.4 \cdot
10^{- 10} \, {\rm eV}$, and can be applied to the next Galactic supernova to
derive the even stronger bound $g_{a \gamma \gamma} \lesssim 2 \cdot 10^{- 13}

carefully analyze the considered ALP production mechanism and find that it is
oversimplified to an unacceptable extent. By taking into account the minimal
ingredients required by a realistic analysis, we conclude that the previous
results are doomed to failure. As a consequence, all papers quoting the above
bound should be properly revised. Yet, since we are unable to rule out the
possibility that protoneutron stars emit ALPs, in case a core-collapse
supernova explodes in the Galaxy the $\gamma$-ray satellite missions active at
that time should look for photons possibly coming from the supernova.

Ba\v{z}ant et al. We apply this model to the collapse of the North Tower of the
World Trade Center to determine the energy dissipation per storey during the
collapse. Our findings are (at most) 250\,MJ during the first 4.6 sec. In the
time interval between 4.6 and 7.7 sec after collapse initiation we find an
additional energy dissipation per storey of 2500\,MJ. Because the steel columns
increase in strength towards the ground this value corresponds to a value of
2000\,MJ for the storeys in the aircraft impact zone. After 7.7 sec the value
reduces again. These results have two possible interpretations: (1) If due to
the building design (column strength, shape etc.) the energy dissipation per
storey cannot reach the high values which we observed, then the collapse cannot
be described by the gravity-driven collapse model. (2) If the collapse is
described correctly by the gravity-driven collapse model, then then we fond
direct evidence that the collapse mechanism did not follow the same pattern
during the whole of the collapse. The possible amount of energy dissipation was
reduced by an order of magnitude during two long time time intervals. In both
cases there is no a priori reason to justify the sometimes expressed belief
that the collapse was inevitable even after the falling top section had gained
a significant amount of momentum. In fact, if the amount of energy dissipation
had stayed only little longer on the high level, then a gravity-driven collapse
would have arrested. Note that (1) implies that if in principle the
gravity-driven collapse model describes gravity-driven collapses of tall
buildings, then the collapse was not gravity-driven.

the angular separation, the co-moving transverse separation, and spherical

validate our distance scale measurement methodology. We measure the angular
diameter distance, $D_A$, at the effective redshift of our sample divided by

error for the long stencil fourth order finite difference approximation, over a

help of discrete Fourier analysis instead of the the standard Taylor expansion.
This in turn results in a reduced regularity requirement for the test function.
In the temporal approximation, we apply a second order BDF stencil, combined
with a second order extrapolation formula applied to the concave diffusion
term, as well as a second order artificial Douglas-Dupont regularization term,
for the sake of energy stability. As a result, the unique solvability, energy
stability are established for the proposed numerical scheme, and an optimal
rate convergence analysis is derived in the $\ell^\infty (0,T; \ell^2) \cap

the corresponding forecasted BAO distance error as a figure-of-merit in the

summarise the validation of the photometric redshift estimation. We
characterise and mitigate observational systematics including stellar
contamination, and show that the clustering on large scales is robust in front
of those contaminants. We show that the clustering signal in the
auto-correlations and cross-correlations is generally consistent with

the wireless network burden during the peak times in a Device-to-Device (D2D in
short) communications. In a coded caching scheme, each file block should be
divided into $F$ packets. It is meaningful to design a coded caching scheme
with the rate and $F$ as small as possible, especially in the practice for D2D
network. In this paper we first characterize coded caching scheme for D2D
network by a simple array called D2D placement delivery array (DPDA in shot).
Consequently some coded caching scheme for D2D network can be discussed by
means of an appropriate DPDA. Secondly we derive the lower bounds on the rate
and $F$ of a DPDA. According these two lower bounds, we show that the
previously known determined scheme proposed by Ji et al., (IEEE Trans. Inform.
Theory, 62(2): 849-869,2016) reaches our lower bound on the rate, but does not
meet the lower bound on $F$ for some parameters. Finally for these parameters,
we construct three classes of DPDAs which meet our two lower bounds. Based on
these DPDAs, three classes of coded caching scheme with low rate and lower $F$
are obtained for D2D network.

discharge from a pediatric intensive care unit (ICU). Design: The means of each
patient's hr, sbp and dbp measurements between their medical and physical
discharge from the ICU were computed as a proxy for their physiologically
acceptable state space (PASS) for successful ICU discharge. These individual
PASS values were compared via root mean squared error (rMSE) to population
age-normal vitals, a polynomial regression through the PASS values of a
Pediatric ICU (PICU) population and predictions from two recurrent neural
network models designed to predict personalized PASS within the first twelve
hours following ICU admission. Setting: PICU at Children's Hospital Los Angeles
(CHLA). Patients: 6,899 PICU episodes (5,464 patients) collected between 2009
and 2016. Interventions: None. Measurements: Each episode data contained 375
variables representing vitals, labs, interventions, and drugs. They also
included a time indicator for PICU medical discharge and physical discharge.
Main Results: The rMSEs between individual PASS values and population
age-normals (hr: 25.9 bpm, sbp: 13.4 mmHg, dbp: 13.0 mmHg) were larger than the
rMSEs corresponding to the polynomial regression (hr: 19.1 bpm, sbp: 12.3 mmHg,
dbp: 10.8 mmHg). The rMSEs from the best performing RNN model were the lowest
(hr: 16.4 bpm; sbp: 9.9 mmHg, dbp: 9.0 mmHg). Conclusion: PICU patients are a
unique subset of the general population, and general age-normal vitals may not
be suitable as target values indicating physiologic stability at discharge.
Age-normal vitals that were specifically derived from the medical-to-physical
discharge window of ICU patients may be more appropriate targets for
'acceptable' physiologic state for critical care patients. Going beyond simple
age bins, an RNN model can provide more personalized target values.

ALMA. There is also growing evidence that disk winds drive accretion in such
disks. We show through 2D (axisymmetric) simulations that rings and gaps
develop naturally in magnetically coupled disk-wind systems on the scale of
tens of au, where ambipolar diffusion (AD) is the dominant non-ideal MHD
effect. In simulations where the magnetic field and matter are moderately
coupled, the disk remains relatively laminar with the radial electric current
steepened by AD into a thin layer near the midplane. The toroidal magnetic
field sharply reverses polarity in this layer, generating a large magnetic
torque that drives fast accretion, which drags the poloidal field into a highly
pinched radial configuration. The reconnection of this pinched field creates
magnetic loops where the net poloidal magnetic flux (and thus the accretion
rate) is reduced, yielding dense rings. Neighbouring regions with stronger
poloidal magnetic fields accrete faster, forming gaps. In better magnetically
coupled simulations, the so-called `avalanche accretion streams' develop
continuously near the disk surface, rendering the disk-wind system more
chaotic. Nevertheless, prominent rings and gaps are still produced, at least in
part, by reconnection, which again enables the segregation of the poloidal
field and the disk material similar to the more diffusive disks. However, the
reconnection is now driven by the non-linear growth of MRI channel flows. The
formation of rings and gaps in rapidly accreting yet laminar disks has
interesting implications for dust settling and trapping, grain growth, and
planet formation.

the error-tolerant big data processing. As most of the data in real world can

sequence-based and set-based similar functions to tolerate errors in data
processing and studies the approximate entity extraction, similarity join and
similarity search problems. The main contributions of this thesis include:
  1. This thesis proposes a unified framework to support approximate entity
extraction with both sequence-based and set-based similarity functions
simultaneously. The experiments show that the unified framework can improve the
state-of-the-art methods by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude.
  2. This thesis designs two methods respectively for the sequence and the set
similarity joins. For the sequence similarity join, this thesis proposes to
evenly partition the sequences to segments. It is guaranteed that two sequences
are similar only if one sequence has a subsequence identical to a segment of
another sequence. For the set similarity join, this thesis proposes to
partition all the sets into segments based on the universe. This thesis further
extends the two partition-based methods to support the large-scale data
processing framework, Map-Reduce and Spark. The partition-based method won the
string similarity join competition held by EDBT and beat the second place by 10
times.
  3. This thesis proposes a pivotal prefix filter technique to solve the
sequence similarity search problem. This thesis shows that the pivotal prefix
filter has stronger pruning power and less filtering cost compared to the

separation on freely moving camera video with possible dense and sparse
corruptions. Our proposed method registers the frames of the corrupted video
and then encodes the varying perspective arising from camera motion as missing
data in a global model. This formulation allows our algorithm to produce a
panoramic background component that automatically stitches together corrupted
data from partially overlapping frames to reconstruct the full field of view.
We model the registered video as the sum of a low-rank component that captures
the background, a smooth component that captures the dynamic foreground of the
scene, and a sparse component that isolates possible outliers and other sparse
corruptions in the video. The low-rank portion of our model is based on a
recent low-rank matrix estimator (OptShrink) that has been shown to yield
superior low-rank subspace estimates in practice. To estimate the smooth
foreground component of our model, we use a weighted total variation framework
that enables our method to reliably decouple the true foreground of the video
from sparse corruptions. We perform extensive numerical experiments on both
static and moving camera video subject to a variety of dense and sparse
corruptions. Our experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of
our proposed method compared to existing methods both in terms of foreground
and background estimation accuracy.

estimators under specific prior distributions. Appropriateness of a particular
class of penalty functions can therefore be interpreted as the appropriateness
of a prior for the parameters. For example, the appropriateness of a lasso
penalty for regression coefficients depends on the extent to which the
empirical distribution of the regression coefficients resembles a Laplace
distribution. We give a testing procedure of whether or not a Laplace prior is
appropriate and accordingly, whether or not using a lasso penalized estimate is
appropriate. This testing procedure is designed to have power against
exponential power priors which correspond to $\ell_q$ penalties. Via
simulations, we show that this testing procedure achieves the desired level and
has enough power to detect violations of the Laplace assumption when the
numbers of observations and unknown regression coefficients are large. We then
introduce an adaptive procedure that chooses a more appropriate prior and
corresponding penalty from the class of exponential power priors when the null
hypothesis is rejected. We show that this can improve estimation of the
regression coefficients both when they are drawn from an exponential power
distribution and when they are drawn from a spike-and-slab distribution.

law with exponent that decreases from ~1.5 to ~1.2 for increasing region size,
while the exponent of the SFR-total gas relation remains constant with value
~1.5 independent of region size. We attribute the molecular law behavior to the
increasingly better sampling of the molecular cloud mass function at larger
region sizes; conversely, the total gas law behavior likely results from the
balance between the atomic and molecular gas phases achieved in regions of
active star formation. Our results indicate a non-linear relation between SFR

connection to another (e.g., a traveler) in the vicinity, but such sharing
consumes the limited data quota in his two-part tariff plan and may lead to
overage charge. This paper studies how to motivate such pH-enabled data-plan
sharing between local users and travelers in the ever-growing roaming markets,
and proposes pricing incentive for a data-plan buyer to reward surrounding pH
sellers (if any). The pricing scheme practically takes into account the
information uncertainty at the traveler side, including the random mobility and
the sharing cost distribution of selfish local users who potentially share pHs.
Though the pricing optimization problem is non-convex, we show that there
always exists a unique optimal price to tradeoff between the successful sharing
opportunity and the sharing price. We further generalize the optimal pricing to
the case of heterogeneous selling pHs who have diverse data usage behaviors in
the sharing cost distributions, and we show such diversity may or may not
benefit the traveler. Lacking selfish pHs' information, the traveler's expected
cost is higher than that under the complete information, but the gap diminishes
as the pHs' spatial density increases. Finally, we analyze the challenging
scenario that multiple travelers overlap for demanding data-plan sharing, by
resorting to a near-optimal pricing scheme. We show that a traveler suffers as
the travelers' spatial density increases.

always expect to reduce the embedding distortion as much as possible, such as
by utilizing a well-designed predictor, taking into account the carrier-content
characteristics, and/or improving modification efficiency etc. However, due to
the diversity of natural images, it is actually very hard to accurately model
the statistical characteristics of natural images, which has limited the
practical use of traditional RDH methods that rely heavily on the content
characteristics. Based on this perspective, instead of directly exploiting the
content characteristics, in this paper, we model the embedding operation on a
weighted bipartite graph to reduce the introduced distortion due to data
embedding, which is proved to be equivalent to a graph problem called as
\emph{minimum weight maximum matching (MWMM)}. By solving the MWMM problem, we
can find the optimal histogram shifting strategy under the given condition.
Since the proposed method is essentially a general embedding model for the RDH,
it can be utilized for designing an RDH scheme. In our experiments, we
incorporate the proposed method into some related works, and, our experimental
results have shown that the proposed method can significantly improve the
payload-distortion performance, indicating that the proposed method could be
desirable and promising for practical use and the design of RDH schemes.

alter the phases of radio signals and reduce the coherence time, putting tight
constraints on high frequency Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI)
observations. In previous works, it has been shown that non-dispersive (e.g.
tropospheric) effects can be calibrated with the frequency phase transfer (FPT)
technique. The coherence time can thus be significantly extended. Ionospheric
effects, which can still be significant, remain however uncalibrated after FPT
as well as the instrumental effects. In this work, we implement a further phase
transfer between two FPT residuals (i.e. so-called FPT-square) to calibrate the
ionospheric effects based on their frequency dependence. We show that after
FPT-square, the coherence time at 3 mm can be further extended beyond 8~hours,
and the residual phase errors can be sufficiently canceled by applying the
calibration of another source, which can have a large angular separation from
the target (>20 deg) and significant temporal gaps. Calibrations for all-sky
distributed sources with a few calibrators are also possible after FPT-square.
One of the strengths and uniqueness of this calibration strategy is the
suitability for high-frequency all-sky survey observations including very weak
sources. We discuss the introduction of a pulse calibration system in the
future to calibrate the remaining instrumental effects and allowing the
possibility of imaging the source structure at high frequencies with
FPT-square, where all phases are fully calibrated without involving any
additional sources.

to omit the natural convection effects on the inaccuracy of measurement for
heat lost quantification. One of the well-known steady-state apparatus is
circular parallel-plate where the distance between circular plates is filled
with liquids or nanofluids. So, it has to be designed accurately to neglect the
effects of free convection. The numerical simulation is a convenient method
which can omit the mentioned effects. Water, Ethylene and Ethylene Glycol are
considered as base liquids and Al2O3 as a Nano-fluid in this work. Thermal
boundary conditions, the distance between two parallel discs, physical and
thermal quantities of fluids, size and volume fraction of nano-particles have
extensive effects on the measurement process. The main result of the simulation
indicates that for all of the cases, the distance between two parallel discs
has to get less than 2 mm for accurate measurement of thermal conductivity in
the parallel circular plate, wherein, uncertainty in the presence of the
natural convection can be easily omitted.

unattended Internet of Things (IoT) low-power devices remotely. To enable this,
in future IoT system, besides the traditional data access points (DAPs) for
collecting data, energy access points (EAPs) should be deployed to charge IoT
devices to maintain their sustainable operations. Practically, the DAPs and
EAPs may be operated by different operators, and the DAPs thus need to provide
effective incentives to motivate the surrounding EAPs to charge their
associated IoT devices. Different from existing incentive schemes, we consider
a practical scenario with asymmetric information, where the DAP is not aware of
the channel conditions and energy costs of the EAPs. We first extend the
existing Stackelberg game-based approach with complete information to the
asymmetric information scenario, where the expected utility of the DAP is
defined and maximized. To deal with asymmetric information more efficiently, we
then develop a contract theory-based framework, where the optimal contract is
derived to maximize the DAP's expected utility as well as the social welfare.
Simulations show that information asymmetry leads to severe performance
degradation for the Stackelberg game-based framework, while the proposed
contract theory-based approach using asymmetric information outperforms the
Stackelberg game-based method with complete information. This reveals that the
performance of the considered system depends largely on the market structure
(i.e., whether the EAPs are allowed to optimize their received power at the IoT
devices with full freedom or not) than on the information availability (i.e.,
the complete or asymmetric information).

  Finite Element method",,,,,"cs.CE cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Beam structure is one of the most widely used structures in mechanical
engineering and civil engineering. Ultrasonic guided wave based crack
identification is one of the most important and accepted approaches applied to
detect unseen small flaws in structures. Numerical simulations of ultrasonic
guided wave propagation have caught more and more attention due to the fast
development of hardware and software in the last few years. From all the
numerical simulation methods, wavelet based finite element method has been
proved to be one of the most efficient methods due to its better spatial
resolution, which means it needs fewer elements to get the same accuracy and it
can improve the calculation cost significantly. However, it needs a very small
time interval. Laplace transform can easily convert the time domain into a
frequency domain and then revert it back to a time domain. Laplace transform
has thus the advantage of finding better results with a very large time
interval. which can save a lot of time cost. This paper will present an
innovative method combining Laplace transform and the B-spline wavelet on
interval (BSWI) finite element method. This novel method allows to get results
with the same accuracy and with a significantly lower time cost, which would
not only decrease the total number of elements in the structure but also
increase the time integration interval. The numerical Laplace transform and
BSWI finite element will be introduced. Moreover, this innovative method is
applied to simulate the ultrasonic wave propagation in a beam structure in
different materials. Numerical examples for crack identification in beam
structures have been studied for verification.

that the predicted X-ray image shows a filamentary structure that arises even
in the absence of disc gas inhomogeneity. This structure stems from warm clumps
made of disc material being lifted by the injected gas. We show that as much as
half of the total X-ray emission comes from regions surrounding warm clumps
that are made of a mix of disk and injected gas. This scenario has the
potential to explain the origin of the observed extra-planar X-ray emission
around star forming galaxies and can be used to understand the observed
sublinear relation between the $L_X$ and SFR. We quantify the mass contained in
these `bow-shock' regions. We also show that the top-most region of the outer
shock above the central area emits harder X-rays than the rest. Further, we
find that the mass distribution in different temperature ranges is bimodal,
peaking at $10^4\hbox{-}10^5$ K (in warm clumps) and $10^6\hbox{-}10^7$ K

polymer in dilute solution, modeled by lattice walks in three dimensions, is
not universal with respect to inter-monomer interactions. It has also been
conjectured that key critical exponents $\phi$, measuring the growth of the
contacts with the surface at the adsorption point, and $1/\delta$, which
measures the finite-size shift of the critical temperature, are not the same.
However, applying standard scaling arguments the two key critical exponents
should be identical, thus pointing to a potential breakdown of these standard
scaling arguments. This is in contrast to the well studied situation in two
dimensions, where there are exact results from conformal field theory: these
exponents are both accepted to be $1/2$ and universal. We use the flatPERM
algorithm to simulate self-avoiding walks and trails on the hexagonal, square
and simple cubic lattices up to length $1024$ to investigate these claims.
Walks can be seen as a repulsive limit of inter-monomer interaction for trails,
allowing us to probe the universality of adsorption. For each model we analyze
several thermodynamic properties to produce different methods of estimating the
critical temperature and the key exponents. We test our methodology on the
two-dimensional cases and the resulting spread in values for $\phi$ and
$1/\delta$ indicates that there is a systematic error that exceeds the
statistical error usually reported. We further suggest a methodology for
consistent estimation of the key adsorption exponents which gives
$\phi=1/\delta=0.484(4)$ in three dimensions. We conclude that in three
dimensions these critical exponents indeed differ from the mean-field value of
$1/2$, but cannot find evidence that they differ from each other. Importantly,
we also find no substantive evidence of any non-universality in the polymer
adsorption transition.

which allows to significantly improve the accuracy of their interpretation. It
is based on the use of three criteria for filtering and processing the
initially obtained experimental information. 1) The criterion of the ""relief of
the nanoscale"", which makes it possible to extract a relief with objects of low
curvature from the overall picture obtained. It is on it that the filler
particles protruding on the surface are clearly visible (usually covered with a
thin film of elastomeric binder, known in the literature as bound rubber). 2)
""Adhesion deflection"" criterion, by means of which it is possible to isolate
the filler particles by changing the adhesion forces between the AFM probe and
the sample surface. 3) The criterion of ""indentational compliance"", designed to
determine the location and stiffness of the filler particles. All these
criteria were used to decode the AFM scanning data of the surface of disperse
filled elastomeric composite. Optimal conditions for the application of each of
the criteria were determined from the analysis of the results obtained. Also,
the accuracy of the experimental results was estimated on the basis of a
comparison of the data obtained with the forward and reverse horizontal motion

models initiated by Greenwood and Williamson (G-W model), which is shown more
accurate under small indentation distance, and the magnification-based pressure
diffusion theory initiated by Persson, which is shown to work well under full
contact conditions. The aim of this paper is to propose a theoretical model
that can effectively formulate the contact status of rough surfaces during the
entire compression process. This is achieved by integrating the idea of
magnification, or evolving resolution into an asperity representation of rough
surfaces, and a magnification-based multi-asperity model is thus established.
In the derived model, the originally complex contact problem is decomposed into
a family of sub-problems each defined on a morphologically simpler contact
islands. Benefiting from the explicit results given by Greenwood and
Williamson, the proposed method is relatively easy for numerical
implementation. Compared to other G-W type models, the proposed method has
especially shown its strength in the computation of the contact area. Moreover,
the G-W and Persson models are found well connected by the proposed method. For
its validation, the proposed model is well compared with existing numerical,
theoretical and experimental results. In particular, the proposed model has
shown its excellency through comparison with representative theoretical,
numerical and experimental data compiled in the contact challenge test by
Mueser et al.

3-body decay of fermionic Dark Matter as the extra electron-positron pair
source responsible for the positron excess. We found that depending on the

explain the combined measurements. While the Dark Matter decay scenario is
constrained by the Fermi-LAT $\gamma$-ray measurement, we show that 3-body

state- of-the-art for computer vision tasks. Due to the large size of these

requirements and cost budgets can be a major hindrance in adoption of CNN for
IoT applications. Recent research highlights that CNN contain significant
redundancy in their structure and can be quantized to lower bit-width
parameters and activations, while maintaining acceptable accuracy. Low
bit-width and especially single bit-width (binary) CNN are particularly
suitable for mobile applications based on FPGA implementation, due to the
bitwise logic operations involved in binarized CNN. Moreover, the transition to
lower bit-widths opens new avenues for performance optimizations and model
improvement. In this paper, we present an automatic flow from trained
TensorFlow models to FPGA system on chip implementation of binarized CNN. This
flow involves quantization of model parameters and activations, generation of
network and model in embedded-C, followed by automatic generation of the FPGA
accelerator for binary convolutions. The automated flow is demonstrated through
implementation of binarized ""YOLOV2"" on the low cost, low power Cyclone- V FPGA
device. Experiments on object detection using binarized YOLOV2 demonstrate
significant performance benefit in terms of model size and inference speed on
FPGA as compared to CPU and mobile CPU platforms. Furthermore, the entire

quantum point contact (QPC) at finite magnetic field. We find that when the QPC
is tuned to be spin selective, at the conductance of e^2/h, a finite bias
induces a dipole-like (spatially anti-symmetric) nuclear polarization: at the
QPC center the polarization is zero, while, for GaAs parameters, the nuclear
spins down (up) are induced on the source (drain) side. We predict that the
dipole-like polarization pattern can be distinguished from a uniform
polarization due to a qualitatively different response of the QPC conductance
to the NMR field.

  Networks",,,,,"math.OC cs.LG cs.SY physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Chemical kinetic mechanisms can be represented by sets of elementary
reactions that are easily translated into mathematical terms using
physicochemical relationships. The schematic representation of reactions
captures the interactions between reacting species and products. Determining
the minimal chemical interactions underlying the dynamic behavior of systems is
a major task. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for the
identification of the influential reactions in chemical reaction networks for
combustion applications, using a data-driven sparse-learning technique. The
proposed approach identifies a set of influential reactions using species
concentrations and reaction rates, with minimal computational cost without
requiring additional data or simulations. The new approach is applied to
analyze the combustion chemistry of H2 and C3H8 in a constant-volume
homogeneous reactor. The influential reactions identified by the
sparse-learning method are consistent with the current kinetics knowledge of
chemical mechanisms. Additionally, we show that a reduced version of the parent
mechanism can be generated as a combination of the influential reactions
identified at different times and conditions and that for both H2 and C3H8 this
reduced mechanism performs closely to the parent mechanism as a function of
ignition delay over a wide range of conditions. Our results demonstrate the
potential of the sparse-learning approach as an effective and efficient tool
for mechanism analysis and mechanism reduction.

abbreviation is an obstacle to improving the performance, as the textual form
of an abbreviation does not express useful information, unless it's expanded to

allow us to predict the average inclusion response under arbitrary time-varying

is called a \emph{Peano compactum} if all its components are Peano continua and

exist several upper semi-continuous decompositions of $K$ into subcontinua such
that the quotient space, equipped with the quotient topology, is a Peano
compactum. We prove that one of these decompositions is finer than all the
others and call it the \emph{core decomposition of $K$ with Peano quotient}.
This core decomposition gives rise to a metrizable quotient space, called the
Peano model of $K$, which is shown to be determined by the topology of $K$ and
hence independent of the embedding of $K$ into $\mathbb{C}$. We also construct
a concrete continuum $K\subset\mathbb{R}^3$ such that the core decomposition of

classes considered by the model, without relying on additional annotations. We
interpret the model through average visualizations of this reduced set of
features. Then, at test time, we explain the network prediction by accompanying
the predicted class label with supporting visualizations derived from the
identified features. In addition, we propose a method to address the artifacts
introduced by stridded operations in deconvNet-based visualizations. Moreover,
we introduce an8Flower, a dataset specifically designed for objective
quantitative evaluation of methods for visual explanation.Experiments on the

detailed explanations with good coverage of relevant features of the classes of

background, we systematically investigate the holographic baryon spectrum in
the case of three flavors. The background geometry in this model is
holographically dual to $U\left(N_{c}\right)$ Yang-Mills theory in large
$N_{c}$ limit involving an excited state with a nonzero $\theta$ angle or glue
condensate $\left\langle \mathrm{Tr}\mathcal{F}\wedge\mathcal{F}\right\rangle
=8\pi^{2}N_{c}\tilde{\kappa}$, which is proportional to the charge density of
the smeared D0-branes through a parameter $b$ or $\tilde{\kappa}$. The
classical solution of baryon in this model can be modified by embedding the
Belavin-Polyakov-Schwarz-Tyupkin (BPST) instanton and we carry out the
quantization of the collective modes with this solution. Then we extend the
analysis to include the heavy flavor and find that the heavy meson is always
bound in the form of the zero mode of the flavor instanton in strong coupling
limit. The mass spectrum of heavy-light baryons in the situation with single-
and double-heavy baryon is derived by solving the eigen equation of the
quantized collective Hamiltonian. Afterwards we obtain that the constraint of
stable baryon states has to be $1<b<3$ and the difference in the baryon
spectrum becomes smaller as the D0 charge increases. It indicates that quarks
or mesons can not form stable baryons if the $\theta$ angle or glue condensate
is sufficiently large. Our work is an extension of the previous study of this
model and also agrees with those conclusions.

based on approximate bisimulation, a notion that has been previously utilized
mainly for symbolic (discrete) abstraction of state spaces. Notable in our
framework is that, in deriving an approximate bisimulation and thus an error
bound, we use a simple incremental stability assumption (namely {\delta}-GUAS)
that does not itself refer to time delays. That this is the same assumption
used for state-space discretization enables a two-step workflow for control
synthesis for switched systems, in which a single Lyapunov-type stability
witness serves for two different purposes of state discretization and coping
with time delays. We demonstrate the proposed framework with a boost DC-DC
converter, a common example of switched systems.

  The specific example of the search for gravitational wave signals in

this purpose, a highly parallel prototype of a future search software is

brightest in published VLBI images at and below 15 GHz. The image noise levels
in our observations are typically 0.3 mJy beam$^{-1}$ and 1.5 mJy beam$^{-1}$

frequencies from the literature, our observations with higher resolution (the
highest resolution up to 0.07 mas at 86 GHz and 0.18 mas at 43 GHz) and at
higher frequencies detected new jet components at sub-parsec scales, offering
valuable data for studies of the physical properties of innermost jets. These
include compactness factor of the radio structure (the ratio of core flux
density to total flux density), and core brightness temperature ($T_{\rm b}$).
In all these sources, the compact core accounts for a significant fraction ($>

Notwithstanding the superior performance on static images, the application of

from performance degeneration and flicking. Such suboptimal results are mainly
attributed to the inability of imposing sequential geometric consistency,
handling severe image quality degradation (e.g. motion blur and occlusion) as
well as the inability of capturing the temporal correlation among video frames.
In this paper, we proposed a novel recurrent network to tackle these problems.
We showed that if we were to impose the weight sharing scheme to the

This property decouples the relationship among multiple network stages and
results in significantly faster speed in invoking the network for videos. It
also enables the adoption of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units between video
frames. We found such memory augmented RNN is very effective in imposing
geometric consistency among frames. It also well handles input quality
degradation in videos while successfully stabilizes the sequential outputs. The

space, time, light and gravity across the entire school curriculum. We have
developed intervention programs and measured their effectiveness in terms of
student attitudes to physics and ability to understand the concepts with
classes from Years 6 to 10. In all cases we observe significant levels of
conceptual understanding and improvement in student attitudes, although the
magnitude of the improvement depends on age group and program duration. This
paper reports an unexpected outcome in regard to gender effects. We have
compared male and female outcomes. In most cases, independent of age group,
academic stream and culture (including one intervention in Indonesia), we find
that females enter our programmes with substantially lower attitude scores than
males, while on completion their attitudes are comparable to the boys. This
provides a strong case for widespread implementation of Einsteinian conceptual
learning across the school curriculum. We discuss possible reasons for this
effect.

acceleration structure that uses a multi-index scheme to accelerate this search

been an important yet challenging issue in the design of evolutionary

in EEC, which is determined cooperatively by operations and parameters in an
EOA. When deficiencies in exploitation or exploration are observed, most
existing works consider a piecemeal approach, either by designing new
operations or by altering the parameters. Unfortunately, when different
situations are encountered, these proposals may fail to be the winner. To
address these problems, this paper proposes an explicit EEC control method
named selective-candidate framework with similarity selection rule (SCSS). M (M
> 1) candidates are first generated from each current solution with independent
operations and parameters to enrich the search. Then, a similarity selection
rule is designed to determine the final candidate by considering the fitness
ranking of the current solution and its Euclidian distance to each of these M
candidates. Superior current solutions will prefer the closest candidates for
efficient local exploitation while inferior ones will favor the farthest for
exploration purpose. In this way, the rule could synthesize exploitation and
exploration, making the evolution more effective. When applied to three
classic, four state-of-the-art and four up-to-date EOAs from branches of
differential evolution, evolution strategy and particle swarm optimization,
significant enhancement in performance is achieved.

variation over the orbit, and their intensity maximum (or minimum) is located
at the superior conjunction (or inferior conjunction) of the M-type star orbit.
The hardness ratio of the X-ray emission shows a small variation over the
orbital phase, and shows no indication of the absorption by an accretion
column. These properties are naturally explained by the emission from the
M-type star surface rather than from the accretion column on the WD's star
similar to the usual IPs. Beside, the observed X-ray emission also modulates
with WD's spin with a pulse fraction of $\sim 14\%$. The peak position is
aligned in the optical/UV/X-ray band. This supports the hypothesis that the
electrons in AR~Scorpii are accelerated to a relativistic speed, and emit
non-thermal photons via the synchrotron radiation. In the X-ray bands, the
evidence of the power-law spectrum is found in the pulsed component, although
the observed emission is dominated by the optically thin thermal plasma
emissions with several different temperatures. It is considered that the
magnetic dissipation/reconnection process on the M-type star surface heats up
the plasma to a temperature of several keV, and also accelerates the electrons
to the relativistic speed. The relativistic electrons are trapped in the WD's
closed magnetic field lines by the magnetic mirror effect. In this model, the
observed pulsed component is explained by the emissions from the first magnetic
mirror point.

us on actual face-to-face contacts, of particular interest to study the
structure of a population in social groups or for use in data-driven models of
information or epidemic spreading processes. Here, we address this issue by
leveraging data sets containing high resolution face-to-face contacts as well
as a coarser spatial localisation of individuals, both temporally resolved, in
various contexts. The co-presence and the face-to-face contact temporal
networks share a number of structural and statistical features, but the former
is (by definition) much denser than the latter. We thus consider several
down-sampling methods that generate surrogate contact networks from the
co-presence signal and compare them with the real face-to-face data. We show
that these surrogate networks reproduce some features of the real data but are
only partially able to identify the most central nodes of the face-to-face
network. We then address the issue of using such down-sampled co-presence data
in data-driven simulations of epidemic processes, and in identifying efficient
containment strategies. We show that the performance of the various sampling
methods strongly varies depending on context. We discuss the consequences of
our results with respect to data collection strategies and methodologies.

from either time or space entanglements of equally separated identical
high-intensity pulses. These specific nonlinear optical structures have gained
interest in recent years with the advent and progress in nonlinear optical
fibers and fiber lasers, photonic crystals, wave-guided wave systems and most
recently optical ring microresonator devices. In this work an extensive
analysis of characteristic features of soliton crystals is carried out, with
emphasis on their one-to-one correspondance with Elliptic solitons. In this
purpose we examine their formation, their stability and their dynamics in
ring-shaped nonlinear optical media within the framework of the Lugiato-Lefever
equation. The stability analysis deals with internal modes of the system via a
$2\times2$-matrix Lam\'e type eigenvalue problem, the spectrum of which is
shown to possess a rich set of boundstates consisting of stable zero-fequency
modes and unstable decaying as well as growing modes. Turning towards the
dynamics of Elliptic solitons in ring-shaped fiber resonators with Kerr
nonlinearity, first of all we propose a collective-coordinate approach, based
on a Lagrangian formalism suitable for Elliptic-soliton solutions to the
nonlinear Schr\'odinger equation with an arbitrary perturbation. Next we derive
time evolutions of Elliptic-soliton parameters in the specific context of
ring-shaped optical fiber resonators, where the optical field evolution is
tought to be governed by the Lugiato-Lefever equation. By solving numerically
the collective-coordinate equations an analysis of the amplitude, the position,
the phase of internal oscillations, the phase velocity and the energy is
carried out and reveals a complex dynamics of the Elliptic soliton in

function $f(x_1, \ldots, x_N)$ of variables $x_i$ which can be accessed via
queries. The complexity of an algorithm is measured by the number of queries
that it makes. Query complexity is widely used for studying quantum algorithms,
for two reasons. First, it includes many of the known quantum algorithms
(including Grover's quantum search and a key subroutine of Shor's factoring
algorithm). Second, one can prove lower bounds on the query complexity,
bounding the possible quantum advantage. In the last few years, there have been
major advances on several longstanding problems in the query complexity. In
this talk, we survey these results and related work, including:
  - the biggest quantum-vs-classical gap for partial functions (a problem
solvable with 1 query quantumly but requiring $\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ queries
classically);
  - the biggest quantum-vs-determistic and quantum-vs-probabilistic gaps for
total functions (for example, a problem solvable with $M$ queries quantumly but

self-steepening causes a uniform shift in position of the pump soliton train,

several groups; however, different values are obtained from different

performed by measuring the angular dependence of neutron scattering by noble

research has focused on the identification of biomarkers and endophenotypes,
using various experimental approaches, it has been recognised that their
instantiations, through computational models, have a great potential to help us
understand and interpret these experimental results. However, the enormous
increase in available neurophysiological and neurocognitive as well as
computational data also poses new challenges. How can a researcher stay on top
of the experimental literature? How can computational modelling data be
efficiently compared to experimental data? How can computational modelling most
effectively inform experimentalists? Recently, a general scientific framework
for the generation of executable tests that automatically compare model results
to experimental observations, SciUnit, has been proposed. Here we exploit this
framework for research in psychiatry to address the challenges mentioned above.
We extend the SciUnit framework by adding an experimental database, which
contains a comprehensive collection of relevant experimental observations, and
a prediction database, which contains a collection of predictions generated by
computational models. Together with appropriately designed SciUnit tests and
methods to mine and visualise the databases, model data and test results, this
extended framework has the potential to greatly facilitate the use of
computational models in psychiatry. As an initial example we present ASSRUnit,

tunneling, conductance G decays with length following the relationship G =
Aexp-\b{\eta}L. It is widely accepted that the attenuation coefficient \b{\eta}
is determined by the position of the Fermi energy of the electrodes relative to
the energy of frontier orbitals of the molecular bridge, whereas the terminal
anchor groups which bind to the molecule to the electrodes contribute to the
pre-exponential factor A. We examine this premise for several series of
molecules which contain a central conjugated moiety (phenyl, viologen or
{\alpha}-terthiophene) connected on either side to alkane chains of varying
length, with each end terminated by thiol or thiomethyl anchor groups. In
contrast with this expectation, we demonstrate both experimentally and
theoretically that additional electronic states located on thiol anchor groups
can significantly decrease the value of \b{eta}, by giving rise to resonances
close to EF through coupling to the bridge moiety. This interplay between the
gateway states and their coupling to a central conjugated moiety in the
molecular bridges creates a new design strategy for realising

we analyze a simple model - the Holstein model - in which the junction is
described by a single electronic level that is coupled to two metallic leads
and to a single vibrational mode. Using the Keldysh Green's function technique,
we calculate the nonsymmetrized current noise to the leading order in the
charge-vibration interaction. For the noise associated to the latter, we
identify distinct terms corresponding to the mean-field noise and the vertex
correction. The mean-field result can be further divided into an elastic
correction to the noise and in an inelastic correction, the second one being
related to energy exchange with the vibration. To illustrate the general
behavior of the noise induced by the charge-vibration interaction, we consider
two limit cases. In the first case, we assume a strong coupling of the dot to
the leads with an energy-independent transmission whereas in the second case we
assume a weak tunneling coupling between the dot and the leads such that the
transport occurs through a sharp resonant level. We find that the noise
associated to the vibration-charge interaction shows a complex pattern as a
function of the frequency $\omega$ and of the transmission function or of the
dot's energy level. Several transitions from enhancement to suppression of the
noise occurs in different regions, which are determined, in particular, by the
vibrational frequency. Remarkably, in the regime of an energy-independent
transmission, the zero order elastic noise vanishes at perfect transmission and
at positive frequency whereas the noise related to the charge-vibration
interaction remains finite enabling the analysis of the pure
vibrational-induced current noise.

The methods first take a few small (inner) steps with a simple, explicit method

solution. Then, the time derivative is estimated and used in an (outer)
Runge-Kutta method of arbitrary order. The procedure can be recursively
repeated on a hierarchy of projective levels to construct telescopic projective
integration methods. Based on the spectrum of the linearized collision
operator, we deduce that the computational cost of the method is essentially
independent of the stiffness of the problem: with an appropriate choice of
inner step size, the time step restriction on the outer time step, as well as
the number of inner time steps, is independent of the stiffness of the

telescopic hierarchy depends logarithmically on the stiffness. We illustrate

galactic potential in spiral arms and galaxy centers suggests that the response
to self-gravity does not always dominate the motions of gas at GMC scales, with
implications for observed gas kinematics, virial equilibrium and cloud
morphology. We describe how a uniform treatment of gas motions in the plane and
in the vertical direction synthesizes the two main mechanisms proposed to
regulate star formation: vertical pressure equilibrium and shear/Coriolis
forces as parameterized by Toomre Q~1. As the modeled motions are coherent and
continually driven by the external potential, they represent support for the
gas that is distinct from that conventionally attributed to turbulence, which
decays rapidly and requires thus maintenance, e.g. via feedback from star
formation. Thus our model suggests the galaxy itself can impose an important
limit to star formation, as we explore in a second paper in this series.

agents. Indifference techniques aim to achieve one or more of three distinct

to manipulate the probability of those events), effective disbelief (where
agents behave as if particular events could never happen), and seamless
transition from one reward function to another (with the agent acting as if
this change is unanticipated). This paper presents several methods for
achieving these goals in the POMDP setting, establishing their uses, strengths,

Interestingly, such an analysis is independent of the particular physical

conditions. Assuming that the geometry of the underlying manifold is controlled
in a suitable way and imposing uniform lower bounds on the zero order
(Weitzenb\""ock) piece of the Dirac Laplacian and on the endomorphism defining
the mixed boundary condition we show that the corresponding conservation
principle holds. A key ingredient in the proof is a domination property for the

formula recently proved in \cite{dL1} in the context of differential forms.
When applied to the Hodge Laplacian acting on differential forms satisfying
absolute boundary conditions, this extends previous results by Vesentini
\cite{Ve} and Masamune \cite{M} in the boundaryless case. Along the way we also
prove a vanishing result for $L^2$ harmonic sections in the broader context of
generalized (not necessarily Dirac) Laplacians. These results are further
illustrated with applications to the Dirac Laplacian acting on spinors and to
the Jacobi operator acting on sections of the normal bundle of a free boundary

complete graph $K_n$ in the sphere. A drawing $D$ of $K_n$ is convex if, for
every 3-cycle $T$ of $K_n$, there is a closed disc $\Delta_T$ bounded by $D[T]$
such that, for any two vertices $u,v$ with $D[u]$ and $D[v]$ both in
$\Delta_T$, the entire edge $D[uv]$ is also contained in $\Delta_T$.
  As one application of this perspective, we consider drawings containing a
non-convex $K_5$ that has restrictions on its extensions to drawings of $K_7$.
For each such drawing, we use convexity to produce a new drawing with fewer
crossings. This is the first example of local considerations providing
sufficient conditions for suboptimality. In particular, we do not compare the
number of crossings {with the number of crossings in} any known drawings. This
result sheds light on Aichholzer's computer proof (personal communication)
showing that, for $n\le 12$, every optimal drawing of $K_n$ is convex.
  Convex drawings are characterized by excluding two of the five drawings of
$K_5$. Two refinements of convex drawings are h-convex and f-convex drawings.
The latter have been shown by Aichholzer et al (Deciding monotonicity of good
drawings of the complete graph, Proc.~XVI Spanish Meeting on Computational

article (Levi's Lemma, pseudolinear drawings of $K_n$, and empty triangles,

bound to the PBHs, which results in an enhanced annihilation rate and increased
indirect detection prospects. We show that such scenarios provide strong
constraints on the allowed fraction of PBHs that constitutes the dark matter,
depending on the WIMP mass $m_{\chi}$ and the velocity-averaged annihilation
cross-section $\langle \sigma v \rangle$. For the standard scenario with
$m_{\chi} = 100\,{\rm GeV}$ and $\langle \sigma v \rangle = 3 \times

azimuthal asymmetries in back-to-back hadron pair production in $e^+e^-$

propose a new way to access this DiFF in $e^+e^-$ annihilation, motivated by
the recently recalculated cross section of this reaction, which explains why
there was in fact no signal for the ${\tt BELLE}$ Collaboration to see. In this
new approach the azimuthal asymmetry is weighted by the virtual photon's
transverse momentum square multiplying sine and cosine functions of difference
of azimuthal angles of relative and total momentum for each pair. The
integration over the virtual photon's transverse momentum has the effect of
separating the convolution between the helicity-dependent DiFFs in the quark
and antiquark jets and results in a nonzero collinear expression containing
Fourier moments of helicity-dependent DiFFs. A second new measurement is also
proposed for two-hadron production in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering,
where the asymmetry is weighted in a similar way for a single pair. This
results in a collinear factorized form of the asymmetry, which includes the
quark helicity parton distribution function and the same helicity-dependent
DiFF as in $e^+e^-$ production and will allow us to check the universality of
this DiFF.

electronic structure and electron-phonon (\emph{e-ph}) coupling for simple
cubic phosphorus by performing first-principle calculations within the full
potential linearized augmented plane wave method. As a function of increasing
pressure, our calculations show a valley feature in T$_c$, followed by an
eventual decrease for higher pressures. We demonstrate that this T$_c$ valley
at low pressures is due to two nearby Lifshitz transitions, as we analyze the
band-resolved contributions to the \emph{e-ph} coupling. Below the first
Lifshitz transition, the phonon hardening and shrinking of the $\gamma$ Fermi
surface with $s$ orbital character results in a decreased T$_c$ with increasing
pressure. After the second Lifshitz transition, the appearance of $\delta$
Fermi surfaces with $3d$ orbital character generate strong \emph{e-ph}
inter-band couplings in $\alpha\delta$ and $\beta\delta$ channels, and hence
lead to an increase of T$_c$. For higher pressures, the phonon hardening
finally dominates, and T$_c$ decreases again. Our study reveals that the
intriguing T$_c$} valley discovered in experiment can be attributed to Lifshitz
transitions, while the plateau of T$_c$ detected at intermediate pressures
appears to be beyond the scope of our analysis. This strongly suggests that
besides \emph{e-ph} coupling, electronic correlations along with plasmonic
contributions may be relevant for simple cubic phosphorous. Our findings hint
at the notion that increasing pressure can shift the low-energy orbital weight
towards $d$ character, and as such even trigger an enhanced importance of
orbital-selective electronic correlations despite an increase of the overall
bandwidth.

achievable when transmitting short packets over a Rician memoryless
block-fading channel for a given requirement on the packet error probability.
We focus on the practically relevant scenario in which there is no \emph{a
priori} channel state information available at the transmitter and at the
receiver. An upper bound built upon the min-max converse is compared to two
lower bounds: the first one relies on a noncoherent transmission strategy in
which the fading channel is not estimated explicitly at the receiver; the
second one employs pilot-assisted transmission (PAT) followed by
maximum-likelihood channel estimation and scaled mismatched nearest-neighbor
decoding at the receiver. Our bounds are tight enough to unveil the optimum
number of diversity branches that a packet should span so that the energy per
bit required to achieve a target packet error probability is minimized, for a
given constraint on the code rate and the packet size. Furthermore, the bounds
reveal that noncoherent transmission is more energy efficient than PAT, even
when the number of pilot symbols and their power is optimized. For example, for
the case when a coded packet of $168$ symbols is transmitted using a channel
code of rate $0.48$ bits/channel use, over a block-fading channel with block
size equal to $8$ symbols, PAT requires an additional $1.2$ dB of energy per
information bit to achieve a packet error probability of $10^{-3}$ compared to
a suitably designed noncoherent transmission scheme. Finally, we devise a PAT
scheme based on punctured tail-biting quasi-cyclic codes and ordered statistics
decoding, whose performance are close ($1$ dB gap at $10^{-3}$ packet error
probability) to the ones predicted by our PAT lower bound. This shows that the
PAT lower bound provides useful guidelines on the design of actual PAT schemes.

to be hugely successful. Regular GANs hypothesize the discriminator as a
classifier with the sigmoid cross entropy loss function. However, we found that
this loss function may lead to the vanishing gradients problem during the
learning process. To overcome such a problem, we propose in this paper the
Least Squares Generative Adversarial Networks (LSGANs) which adopt the least
squares loss for both the discriminator and the generator. We show that
minimizing the objective function of LSGAN yields minimizing the Pearson
$\chi^2$ divergence. We also show that the derived objective function that
yields minimizing the Pearson $\chi^2$ divergence performs better than the
classical one of using least squares for classification. There are two benefits
of LSGANs over regular GANs. First, LSGANs are able to generate higher quality
images than regular GANs. Second, LSGANs perform more stably during the
learning process. For evaluating the image quality, we conduct both qualitative
and quantitative experiments, and the experimental results show that LSGANs can
generate higher quality images than regular GANs. Furthermore, we evaluate the
stability of LSGANs in two groups. One is to compare between LSGANs and regular
GANs without gradient penalty. We conduct three experiments, including Gaussian
mixture distribution, difficult architectures, and a newly proposed method ---
datasets with small variability, to illustrate the stability of LSGANs. The
other one is to compare between LSGANs with gradient penalty (LSGANs-GP) and
WGANs with gradient penalty (WGANs-GP). The experimental results show that
LSGANs-GP succeed in training for all the difficult architectures used in
WGANs-GP, including 101-layer ResNet.

specially during the embedded phase. To gain insight into the dominant
formation mechanism of very low-mass objects and brown dwarfs, we conducted
deep observations at 870$\mu$m with the LABOCA bolometer at the APEX telescope.
Our goal was to identify young sub-mm sources in the Barnard 30 dark cloud. We
complemented these data with multi-wavelength observations from the optical to
the far-IR and. As a result, we have identified 34 submm sources and a
substantial number of possible and probable Barnard 30 members within each
individual APEX/LABOCA beam. They can be classified in three distinct groups.
First, 15 out of these 34 have a clear optical or IR counterpart to the submm
peak and nine of them are potential proto-BDs candidates. Moreover, a
substantial number of them could be multiple systems. A second group of 13
sources comprises candidate members with significant infrared excesses located
away from the central submm emission. All of them include brown dwarf
candidates, some displaying IR excess, but their association with submm
emission is unclear. In addition, we have found six starless cores and, based
on the total dust mass estimate, three might be pre-substellar (or pre-BDs)
cores. Finally, the complete characterization of our APEX/LABOCA sources,
focusing on those detected at 24 and/or 70 $\mu$m, indicates that in our sample
of 34 submm sources there are, at least: two WTTs, four CTTs, five young
stellar objects (YSOs), eight proto-BD candidates (with another three dubious
cases), and one Very Low Luminosity object (VeLLO).

30) spatially unresolved sources with ALMA, with estimated masses between 0.9

analysis of multi-wavelength photometry from these two objects, namely B30-LB14

object, respectively. The gas emission is consistent with a rotating disk in
the case of B30-LB14, and with an oblate rotating envelope with infall
signatures in the case of LB19. The remaining three ALMA detections do not have
infrared counterparts and can be classified as either deeply embedded objects
or as starless cores if B30 members. In the former case, two of them (LB08 and
LB31) show internal luminosity upper limits consistent with Very Low Luminosity

scenario, and taking into account the estimated masses from ALMA and the
APEX/LABOCA cores, we estimate final masses for the central objects in the
substellar domain, so they could be classified as pre-BD core candidates.

particle, which may be either scalar or an abelian gauge field, both of them in
(3+1) dimensions. Thereafter, we consider that the matter field propagates only
in (2+1) dimensions, whereas the bosonic field is free to propagate out of the

reduction, which yields an effective model in (2+1) dimensions. In particular,
for the gauge-field case, we use the Stueckelberg mechanism in order to
preserve gauge invariance. We refer to this version as nonlocal-Proca quantum
electrodynamics (NPQED). For both scalar and gauge cases, the effective models
reproduce the usual $e^{-m r}/r$ Yukawa interaction in the static limit. By
means of perturbation theory at one loop, we calculate the mass renormalization
of the Dirac field. Our model is a generalization of Pseudoquantum
electrodynamics (PQED), which is a gauge-field model that provides a Coulomb
interaction for two-dimensional electrons. Possibilities of application to
Fermi-Bose mixtures in mixed dimensions, using cold atoms, are briefly

to provide a first performance baseline for the automated classification of
functional gait disorders for a large-scale dataset. The utilized database
comprises GRF measurements from 279 patients with gait disorders (GDs) and data
from 161 healthy controls (N). Patients were manually classified into four
classes with different functional impairments associated with the ""hip"",
""knee"", ""ankle"", and ""calcaneus"". Different parameterizations are investigated:
GRF parameters, global principal component analysis (PCA)-based representations
and a combined representation applying PCA on GRF parameters. The
discriminative power of each parameterization for different classes is
investigated by linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Based on this analysis, two
classification experiments are pursued: (1) distinction between healthy and
impaired gait (N vs. GD) and (2) multi-class classification between healthy
gait and all four GD classes. Experiments show promising results and reveal
among others that several factors, such as imbalanced class cardinalities and
varying numbers of measurement sessions per patient have a strong impact on the
classification accuracy and therefore need to be taken into account. The
results represent a promising first step towards the automated classification
of gait disorders and a first performance baseline for future developments in

attributed to the existence of an absolute spacetime, which makes Mach's
principle unfeasible. In this paper, we shall revisit, and support, this
argument from a different viewpoint using the Sagnac delay. This is possible
since the above time asynchrony is known to be exactly the same as the Sagnac
delay between two circumnavigating light rays re-uniting at the orbiting
source/receiver. We shall calculate the effect of mass $M$ and cosmological
constant $\Lambda$ on the delay in the general case of Kerr-de Sitter
spacetime. It follows that, in the independent limits $M\rightarrow 0$, spin
$a\rightarrow 0$ and $\Lambda\rightarrow 0$, while the Kerr-dS metric reduces
to Minkowski metric, the clocks need not tick in consonance since there will
still appear a non-zero observable Sagnac delay. While we do not measure
spacetime itself, we do measure the Sagnac effect, which signifies an absolute
substantive Minkowski spacetime instead of a void. We shall demonstrate a
completely different limiting behavior of Sagnac delay, heretofore unknown,

electron beam in the magnet. The compactness is achieved by means of a shallow
channel which leads to an electromagnetic shower in the Cu-W body of the
channel and surrounding material after a 1-2~mm deflection of the beam
electrons by a horizontal magnetic field.
  This source will allow us to achieve ten times the luminosity of the mixed
electron--photon beam configuration while keeping the heat load on the
(polarized) target as well as the radiation level in the experimental hall at
acceptable levels. The concept for this device was developed for the
experimental proposal PR12-15-003 but, if built, it would become a
general--purpose source that would be usable for a variety of photon--induced
reactions of interest in the 12-GeV era.

nevertheless retain some 'memory' of any previous calibration that served as
the starting point (especially for the manually-tuned models). For the first
calibration, models reproduce the observed z = 0 galaxy stellar mass function
(SMF) within 3-{\sigma}. The second calibration extended the observational data
to include the z = 2 SMF alongside the z~0 star formation rate function, cold
gas mass and the black hole-bulge mass relation. Encapsulating the observed
evolution of the SMF from z = 2 to z = 0 is found to be very hard within the
context of the physics currently included in the models. We finally use our
calibrated models to study the evolution of the stellar-to-halo mass (SHM)
ratio. For all models we find that the peak value of the SHM relation decreases
with redshift. However, the trends seen for the evolution of the peak position
as well as the mean scatter in the SHM relation are rather weak and strongly
model dependent. Both the calibration data sets and model results are publicly

The event occurred on April 23, 2009. It had an impulsive acceleration phase,
an impulsive deceleration phase, and a second impulsive acceleration phase.
During its evolution, the CME showed signatures of different acceleration
mechanisms: kink instability, prominence drainage, flare reconnection, and a
CME-CME collision. The special feature of the observations is the usage of the
TESIS EUV telescope. The instrument could image the solar corona in the Fe 171
\AA\ line up to a distance of 2 $R_\odot$ from the center of the Sun. This
allows us to trace the CME up to the LASCO/C2 field of view without losing the
CME from sight. The onset of the CME was caused by kink instability. The mass
drainage occurred after the kink instability. The mass drainage played only an
auxiliary role: it decreased the CME mass, which helped to accelerate the CME.
The first impulsive acceleration phase was caused by the flare reconnection. We
observed the two ribbon flare and an increase of the soft X-ray flux during the
first impulsive acceleration phase. The impulsive deceleration and the second
impulsive acceleration phases were caused by the CME-CME collision. The studied
event shows that CMEs are complex phenomena that cannot be explained with only
one acceleration mechanism. We should seek a combination of different
mechanisms that accelerate CMEs at different stages of their evolution.

that $S$ resides in a random-access memory that can only be read. The edges of
the Euclidean minimum spanning tree $\text{EMST}(S)$ have to be reported
sequentially, and they cannot be accessed or modified afterwards. There is a
parameter $s \in \{1, \dots, n\}$ so that the algorithm may use $O(s)$ cells of
read-write memory (called the workspace) for its computations. Our goal is to
find an algorithm that has the best possible running time for any given $s$

  We show how to compute $\text{EMST}(S)$ in $O\big((n^3/s^2)\log s \big)$ time

known bounds $O(n^3)$ for $s = 1$ and $O(n \log n)$ for $s = n$. For this, we
run Kruskal's algorithm on the relative neighborhood graph (RNG) of $S$. It is
a classic fact that the minimum spanning tree of $\text{RNG}(S)$ is exactly
$\text{EMST}(S)$. To implement Kruskal's algorithm with $O(s)$ cells of

number of nodes with a comparatively small number of external inputs, a process

shown that surprisingly, temporal networks can enjoy tremendous control
advantages over their static counterparts despite the fact that in temporal
networks such paths are seldom instantaneously available. To understand the
underlying reasons, here we systematically analyze the scaling behavior of a
key control cost for temporal networks--the control energy. We show that the
energy costs of controlling temporal networks are determined solely by the
spectral properties of an ""effective"" Gramian matrix, analogous to the static
network case. Surprisingly, we find that this scaling is largely dictated by
the first and the last network snapshot in the temporal sequence, independent

ensure that smart contracts running in EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) will be
eventually terminated. Failing to properly set the gas costs of EVM operations
allows attackers to launch DoS attacks on Ethereum. Although Ethereum recently
adjusted the gas costs of EVM operations to defend against known DoS attacks,
it remains unknown whether the new setting is proper and how to configure it to
defend against unknown DoS attacks. In this paper, we make the first step to
address this challenging issue by first proposing an emulation-based framework
to automatically measure the resource consumptions of EVM operations. The
results reveal that Ethereum's new setting is still not proper. Moreover, we
obtain an insight that there may always exist exploitable under-priced
operations if the cost is fixed. Hence, we propose a novel gas cost mechanism,
which dynamically adjusts the costs of EVM operations according to the number
of executions, to thwart DoS attacks. This method punishes the operations that
are executed much more frequently than before and lead to high gas costs. To
make our solution flexible and secure and avoid frequent update of Ethereum
client, we design a special smart contract that collaborates with the updated
EVM for dynamic parameter adjustment. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method can effectively thwart both known and unknown DoS attacks with flexible
parameter settings. Moreover, our method only introduces negligible additional
gas consumption for benign users.

severe restriction of the data sets is not necessary. Building upon recent
advances in mathematical phylogenetics we demonstrate that gene duplications
convey meaningful phylogenetic information and allow the inference of plausible
phylogenetic trees, provided orthologs and paralogs can be distinguished with a
degree of certainty. Starting from tree-free estimates of orthology, cograph
editing can sufficiently reduce the noise in order to find correct
event-annotated gene trees. The information of gene trees can then directly be
translated into constraints on the species trees. While the resolution is very
poor for individual gene families, we show that genome-wide data sets are
sufficient to generate fully resolved phylogenetic trees, even in the presence
of horizontal gene transfer.
  We demonstrate that the distribution of paralogs in large gene families
contains in itself sufficient phylogenetic signal to infer fully resolved
species phylogenies. This source of phylogenetic information is independent of
information contained in orthologous sequences and is resilient against
horizontal gene transfer. An important consequence is that phylogenomics data
sets need not be restricted to 1:1 orthologs.

the telegrapher's equation, also called hyperbolic heat conduction equation.
These equations have been designed to resolve the paradox of the infinite speed
in the heat and diffusion equations. The finiteness of both the speed and the
correlation length leads to several classes of random walks: Persistent random
walk in one dimension can display anomalies that cannot arise for Brownian
motion such as anisotropy and asymmetries. In this work we focus on the case
where the mean free path is anisotropic, the only anomaly leading to a physics
that is different from the telegrapher's case. We derive exact expression of

In particular, our method uses a recently developed scaled exponential linear
unit (SELU) as a nonlinear self-normalising activation function, which for the
first time has been applied in medical imaging with CNN. SELU has important
advantages such as being parameter-free and mini-batch independent, which may
help to overcome memory constraints during training. A dataset with 91 images
from 35 patients during Valsalva, contraction and rest, all labelled by three
operators, is used for training and evaluation in a leave-one-patient-out
cross-validation. Results show a median Dice similarity coefficient of 0.90
with an interquartile range of 0.08, with equivalent performance to the three
operators (with a Williams' index of 1.03), and outperforming a U-Net
architecture without the need for batch normalisation. We conclude that the
proposed fully automatic method achieved equivalent accuracy in segmenting the
pelvic floor levator hiatus compared to a previous semi-automatic approach.

various orientations and face appearance visibility. Therefore, a descriptive
representation of face images and mapping it to poses are critical. In this
paper, we make use of multi-modal data and propose a novel face pose estimation
method that uses a novel deep learning framework named Multi-task Manifold Deep
Learning $M^2DL$. It is based on feature extraction with improved deep neural
networks and multi-modal mapping relationship with multi-task learning. In the
proposed deep learning based framework, Manifold Regularized Convolutional

this way, the computed mapping model with multiple tasks is improved.

a tool called vertex sparsification, which is a way to compress large graphs

algorithms.
  Using this framework, we obtain a Monte Carlo randomized fully dynamic
algorithm for $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximating the energy of electrical flows in
$n$-vertex planar graphs with $\tilde{O}(r\varepsilon^{-2})$ worst-case update
time and $\tilde{O}((r+\frac{n}{\sqrt{r}})\varepsilon^{-2})$ worst-case query

$\tilde{O}(n^{2/3}\varepsilon^{-2})$ update time and
$\tilde{O}(n^{2/3}\varepsilon^{-2})$ query time. We also extend this algorithm
to work for minor-free graphs with similar approximation and running time
guarantees. Furthermore, we illustrate our framework on the all-pairs max flow
and shortest path problems by giving corresponding dynamic algorithms in
minor-free graphs with both sublinear update and query times. To the best of
our knowledge, our results are the first to systematically establish such a
connection between dynamic graph algorithms and vertex sparsification.

based on dispersive Fourier transform and suitably designed modulation module,
to perform mathematical operations of interest, such as differentiation,
integration, or convolution in time domain. The desired mathematical operation
is performed as signal propagates through a fully reconfigurable on-chip
photonic signal processor. Although a few number of photonic temporal signal
processors have been introduced recently, they are usually bulky or they suffer
from limited reconfigurability which is of great importance to implement
large-scale general-purpose photonic signal processors. To address these
limitations, this paper demonstrates a fully reconfigurable photonic integrated
signal processing system. As the key point, the reconfigurability is achieved
by taking advantages of dispersive Fourier transformation, linearly chirp
modulation using four wave mixing, and applying the desired arbitrary transfer
function through a cascaded Mach-Zehnder modulator and phase modulator. Our
demonstration reveals an operation time of $200~ps$ with high resolution of
$300~fs$. To have an on-chip photonic signal processor, a broadband photonic
crystal waveguide with an extremely large group-velocity dispersion of $2.81
\times {10^{6}}~\frac{{{ps^2}}}{km}$ is utilized. Numerical simulations of the
proposed structure reveal a great potential for chip-scale fully reconfigurable

expected to accelerate relativistic electrons, thus generating a spectrally
flat leptonic virial ring. However attempts to detect virial rings have all
failed, leaving the shock paradigm unconfirmed. Here we identify a virial
$\gamma$-ray signal by stacking Fermi-LAT data for 112 clusters, enhancing the
ring sensitivity by rescaling clusters to their virial radii and utilizing the
anticipated spectrum. In addition to a central unresolved, hard signal
(detected at the nominal $5.8\sigma$ confidence level), probably dominated by
active galactic nuclei, we identify ($5.9\sigma$) a bright, spectrally flat

0.6\%$ (with an uncertainty factor $\sim2$) thermal energy deposition in
relativistic electrons over a Hubble time. This result validates the shock

to improve classical cryptanalytic methods using quantum algorithms. In this

differential cryptanalysis and impossible differential cryptanalysis. Based on
the fact that Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm can be used to find the linear
structures of Boolean functions, we propose two quantum algorithms that can be
used to find high-probability truncated differentials and impossible

found to increase with respect to the fractional dimension, D, of the graph.
Additionally, the sample-entropy curves increased in an exponential fashion
with increasing D. This increase in the complexity was found to correspond to a
rising amount of irregularities in the oscillations. In terms of the colored
noise, the complexity of the fluctuations was found to be highest for the 1/f
noise (f is the frequency of the generated noise), which is in agreement with
findings in the literature. Moreover, the sample-entropy curves exhibited a
decreasing trend for noise when the spectral exponent, \beta, was less than 1
and obeyed an increasing trend when \beta > 1. Importantly, a direct
relationship was observed between the power-law exponents for the curves and
the spectral exponents of the noise. For the logistic map, a correspondence was
observed between the complexity maps and its bifurcation diagrams.
Specifically, the map of the sample-entropy curves was negligible when the

  characterization to surface wave analysis","29 pages, 9 figures",,,,"physics.optics physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Metasurfaces offer great potential to control near- and far-fields through
engineering of optical properties of elementary cells or meta-atoms. Such
perspective opens a route to efficient manipulation of the optical signals both
at nanoscale and in photonics applications. In this paper we show that by using
an effective surface conductivity tensor it is possible to unambigiously
describe optical properties of an anisotropic metasurface in the far- and
near-field regimes. We begin with retrieving the effective surface conductivity
tensor from the comparative analysis of experimental and numerical reflectance
spectra of a metasurface composed of elliptical gold nanoparticles. Afterwards
restored conductivities are validated in the crosscheck versus semianalytic
parameters obtained with the discrete dipole model with and without dipoles
interaction contribution. The obtained effective parameters are further used
for the dispersion analysis of surface plasmons localized at the metasurface.
The effective medium model predicts existence of both TE- and TM-polarized
plasmons in a wide range of optical frequencies and describes peculiarities of
their dispersion, in particularly, topological transition from the elliptical
to hyperbolic regime with eligible accuracy. The analysis in question offers a
simple practical way to describe properties of metasurfaces including ones in
the near-field zone by extracting effective parameters from the convenient
far-field characterisation.

  earthquake monitoring","10 pages, 4 figures",,,,"physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Earthquake monitoring across the globe is currently achieved with networks of
seismic stations. The data from these networks have been instrumental in
advancing our understanding of the Earth's interior structure and dynamic
behaviour. However, almost all seismic stations are located on land and
earthquakes of magnitude smaller than 4 at the bottom of the oceans remain
largely undetected. Here we show that ordinary telecommunication optical fibre
links can detect seismic events when combined with state-of-the-art frequency
metrology techniques. We have detected earthquakes over terrestrial and
submarine optical fibre links with length ranging from 75 to 535 km and a
geographical distance from the earthquake's epicentre ranging from 25 to 18,500
km. In contrast to existing commercial reflectometry-based acoustic sensing
methods used widely in the oil and gas industry, which are limited to only a
few tens of kilometres, the technique presented here can be extended over
thousands of kilometres, paving the way for detection of remote underwater
earthquakes. By using the proposed technique on the existing extensive
submarine optical fibre infrastructure, which already criss-crosses the seas
and oceans, a global seismic network for real-time detection of underwater
earthquakes could be implemented. The ability to detect off-shore earthquakes
closer to the source could also enable a cost-effective solution for early
detection of tsunamis.

used to detect generalized synchronization in non-identical coupled systems.
These methods generally give contradictory results. Therefore one method alone
is not sufficient to predict correct result. We show in this report that it is
necessary to apply multiple methods together to come to a conclusion. These
methods show a signature of generalized synchronization in diffusively coupled
non-identical chaotic parametric excited pendula. But we finally find it to be
the almost synchronization. It is achieved when the second Lyapunov exponent
and both the system's transverse Lyapunov exponents are almost equal. The
transition from asynchronous state to almost synchronization is through
frequency entrainment as coupling constant is increased. Non-identity of the
pendula are realized by mismatch in amplitude of parametric forcing. The
frequency entrainment regime does not depend on amplitude mismatch whereas
onset of almost synchronization increases with increase in mismatch. The

linear and nonlinear optical properties of graphene nanoflakes (GNFs). In
contrast to the widely used tight-binding description of the electronic states
that considers only the nearest-neighbor coupling between the atoms, our
approach is more accurate and general, as it captures the electron-core
interactions between all atoms in the structure. Therefore, as we demonstrate,
the DNQM approach enables the investigation of the optical coupling between two
closely separated, but chemically unbound GNFs. We also find that the optical
response of GNFs depends crucially on their shape, size, and symmetry
properties. Specifically, increasing the size of nanoflakes is found to shift
their accommodated quantum plasmon oscillations to lower frequency.
Importantly, we show that by embedding a cavity into GNFs, one can change their
symmetry properties, tune their optical properties, or enable otherwise
forbidden second-harmonic generation processes.

considerable research interest in recent years. Many works have been dedicated
to the modelling and optimisation of the cantilevered geometry to increase
power density, bandwidth, etc. The increased efficiency coming from the use of
trapezoidal beams has been recognised, but little has been done to produce the
same uniform strain within the most commonly available rectangular beams. This
work proposes a new approach via a smart compliant structure which permits to
deform a set of bimorphs in pure bending. Furthermore, since the deflections
are synchronous, the power signals produced are in phase and power conditioning
is simplified and made more efficient. The kinematic requirements for uniform
strain are discussed, the novel structure is proposed and modelled with finite
elements, a prototype is presented and characterised to support the modelling.
The proposed structure induces almost perfectly uniform strain in the
piezoelectric beams for all useful rotation angles, demonstrating that,
compared to a traditional cantilever, twice as many charges can be produced
when the same maximum strain is applied to the material. Synchronicity is also
experimentally verified for the prototype, as power signals resulting from
impact excitation are observed to be in phase. The principle of synchronous
pure bending via helper structures can be applied in general to increase the
performance of piezoelectric energy harvesters.
