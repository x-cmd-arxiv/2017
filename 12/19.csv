J0815+4729. This dwarf star was selected from SDSS/BOSS as a metal-poor
candidate and follow-up spectroscopic observations at medium-resolution were
obtained with ISIS at William Herschel Telescope and OSIRIS at Gran Telescopio
de Canarias. We use the FERRE code to derive the main stellar parameters,
Teff=6215+-82 K, and logg=4.7+-0.5, an upper limit to the metallicity of
[Fe/H]<~-5.8, and a carbon abundance of [C/Fe]>~+5.0, while [alpha/Fe]=0.4 is
assumed. The metallicity upper limit is based on the Ca II K line, that at the
resolving power of the OSIRIS spectrograph cannot be resolved from possible
interstellar calcium. The star could be the most iron-poor unevolved star
known, and is also amongst the ones with the largest overabundances of carbon.
High-resolution spectroscopy of J0815+4729 will certainly help to derive other
important element abundances, possibly providing new fundamental constraints on
the early stages of the Universe, the formation of the first stars and the
properties of the first supernovae.

controlling the power between the fundamental and the higher transverse cavity

the potential of creating more complex trapping geometries such as uniform

closest agreement is with the hyper-Raman data, both techniques yield the same

the temperature T* ~ 400 K. In addition to evaluation of the IR-THz data using
fitting with standard factorized form of the dielectric function, we performed
a successful fitting of the same data using the effective medium approach
(EMA), originally based on the assumption that the mesoscopic structure of PMN
consists of randomly oriented uniaxially anisotropic polar nanodomains (PNDs)
with somewhat harder TO polar modes in the direction along the local PND dipole
(Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 027601 (2006)). Evaluation using the Bruggeman EMA
modelling has been successfully applied in the entire investigated temperature
range. These results suggest that the response perpendicular to the local
dipole moment, at high temperatures induced by random fields rather than PNDs,
undergoes a classical softening from high temperatures with permittivity
obeying the Curie-Weiss law, eps_per = C/(T-Tc), C = 1.7 x 10^5 K and Tc = 380
K. Below the Burns temperature ~620 K, a GHz relaxation ascribed to flipping of
the PNDs emerges from the soft mode response, slows down and broadens,
remaining quite strong towards the cryogenic temperatures, where it can be
assigned to fluctuations of the PND boundaries.

successfully explained, for a single frequency shifting mode, in terms of

  Here, we introduce stochasticity into a 1D kinetic model, affecting the
formation and evolution of resonant modes in the system. We find that noise in
the fast particle distribution or electric field leads to a shift in the
asymptotic behaviour of a chirping resonant mode; this noise heuristically maps
onto microturbulence via canonical toroidal momentum scattering, affecting hole
and clump formation. The profile of a single bursting event in mode amplitude
is shown to be stochastic, with small changes in initial conditions affecting
the lifetime of a hole and clump. As an extension to the work of Lang and Fu,
we find that an intermediate regime exists where noise serves to decrease the
effective collisionality, where microturbulence works against pitch-angle

these systems. We have used supervised machine learning methods to search 0.8
million lightcurves from the Palomar Transient Factory, combined with SDSS,
Pan-STARRS and 2MASS colours. The new systems range in orbital periods from
0.46-3.8 d and in apparent brightness from ~14-16 mag in the PTF $R$ or
$g^{\prime}$ filters. For twelve of the systems, we obtained radial velocity
curves with the Intermediate Dispersion Spectrograph at the Isaac Newton
Telescope. We modelled the lightcurves, radial velocity curves and spectral
energy distributions to determine the system parameters. The radii (0.3-0.7
$\mathrm{R_{\odot}}$) and effective temperatures (8000-17000 K) of the
pre-He-WDs are consistent with stellar evolution models, but the masses
(0.12-0.28 $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) show more variance than models predicted. This
study shows that using machine learning techniques on large synoptic survey
data is a powerful way to discover substantial samples of binary systems in
short-lived evolutionary stages.

band gap in solids was shown to be much more accurate than the common local
density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The
main feature of the GLLB-SC potential (SC stands for solid and correlation) is
to lead to a nonzero derivative discontinuity that can be conveniently
calculated and then added to the Kohn-Sham band gap for a comparison with the
experimental band gap. In this work, a thorough comparison of GLLB-SC with
other methods, e.g., the modified Becke-Johnson (mBJ) potential [F. Tran and P.

GLLB-SC does not perform as well as mBJ for systems with a small band gap and
strongly correlated systems, but is on average of similar accuracy as hybrid
functionals. The results on itinerant metals indicate that GLLB-SC
overestimates significantly the magnetic moment (much more than mBJ does), but
leads to excellent results for the electric field gradient, for which mBJ is in
general not recommended. In the aim of improving the results, variants of the
GLLB-SC potential are also tested.

non-singularity of the approximate Gramian if the original system is observable

forecast sensitivity gain, 20 to 125 Hz median, of approximately 51%, or from
20 to 250 Hz, 11%, given the same per-band cost and setup. This paper's timing
model enables future setup optimization. Resampling scales well with longer

transport processes operating in the stellar interior. We revisit the
relationship between lithium content and rotation rate previously reported for
cool dwarfs in the Pleiades cluster. We derive new LiI 670.8 nm equivalent
width measurements from high-resolution spectra obtained for low-mass Pleiades
members. We combine these new measurements with previously published ones, and
use the Kepler/K2 rotational periods recently derived for Pleiades cool dwarfs
to investigate the lithium-rotation connection in this 125 Myr-old cluster. The
new data confirm the correlation between lithium equivalent width and stellar
spin rate for a sample of 51 early K-type members of the cluster, where fast
rotating stars are systematically lithium-rich compared to slowly rotating
ones. The correlation is valid for all stars over the (J-Ks) color range
0.50-0.70 mag, corresponding to a mass range from about 0.75 to 0.90 solar
mass, and may extend down to lower masses. We argue that the dispersion in
lithium equivalent widths observed for cool dwarfs in the Pleiades cluster
reflects an intrinsic scatter in lithium abundances, and suggest that the
physical origin of the lithium dispersion pattern is to be found in the
pre-main sequence rotational history of solar-type stars.

moreover also the classical linear dependence measures: covariance, Pearson's
correlation and the RV coefficient appear as limiting cases. Based on distance
multivariance several new measures are defined: a multicorrelation which
satisfies a natural set of multivariate dependence measure axioms and
$m$-multivariance which is a dependence measure yielding tests for pairwise
independence and independence of higher order. These tests are computationally
feasible and under very mild moment conditions they are consistent against all
alternatives. Moreover, a general visualization scheme for higher order
dependencies is proposed, including consistent estimators (based on distance
multivariance) for the dependence structure.
  Many illustrative examples are provided. All functions for the use of

finds the physical eigenstates and compares them to the quantum-graph

potential well made by crossing two quantum wires, and we consider a massive
particle in such an X well. The system is analyzed using a variational method
based on an expansion into modes with fast convergence and it provides a very
clear intuition for the physics of the problem. The particle is found to have a
ground state that is exponentially localized to the center of the X well, and
the other symmetric solutions are formed so to be orthogonal to the ground
state. This is in contrast to the predictions of the conventionally used
so-called Kirchoff boundary conditions in quantum graph theory that predict a
different sequence of symmetric solutions that cannot be physically realized.
Numerical methods have previously been the only source of information on the
ground-state wave function and our results provide a different perspective with
strong analytical insights. The ground-state wave function has the shape of a
solitonic solution to the non-linear Schr{\""o}dinger equation, enabling an
analytical prediction of the wave number. When combining multiple X wells into
a network or grid, each site supports a solitonic localized state. The solitons
only couple to each other and are able to jump from one site to another as if
they were trapped in a discrete lattice.

Numerical simulations by a number of authors have demonstrated that, with

clustering in the orbital elements of the population of distant TNOs, similar
to the observed sample. However, many aspects of the rich underlying dynamical
processes induced by such a distant eccentric perturber have not been fully

that are possible. In particular, we find that chaos and resonance overlap
plays an important role in particles' dynamical evolution. We develop a simple
mapping model that allows us to understand, in detail, the web of overlapped
mean-motion resonances explored by chaotically evolving particles. We also
demonstrate that gravitational interactions with Neptune can have profound
effects on the orbital evolution of particles. Our results serve as a starting

collapse applies to the exotic cubulations of free groups constructed by Wise.
Next, we show that the CAT(0) cube complexes constructed by Cashen-Macura can

global. In this paper we study Grover search under the influence of localized

retained. Once these restrictions are not met, the quadratic speedup is lost.
In particular, if the target is affected by the noise, the noise rate needs to
scale as $1/\sqrt{N}$ in order to keep the speedup. We observe also an
intermediate region, where if $k\sim N^\mu$ and the target is unaffected, the
speedup seems to obey $N^\mu$, which for $\mu>0.5$ is worse than the quantum,
but better than the classical case. We put obtained results for quantum

of SGD observed in modern machine learning. The key observation is that most
modern learning architectures are over-parametrized and are trained to
interpolate the data by driving the empirical loss (classification and
regression) close to zero. While it is still unclear why these interpolated
solutions perform well on test data, we show that these regimes allow for fast
convergence of SGD, comparable in number of iterations to full gradient
descent.
  For convex loss functions we obtain an exponential convergence bound for {\it
mini-batch} SGD parallel to that for full gradient descent. We show that there
is a critical batch size $m^*$ such that: (a) SGD iteration with mini-batch
size $m\leq m^*$ is nearly equivalent to $m$ iterations of mini-batch size $1$
(\emph{linear scaling regime}). (b) SGD iteration with mini-batch $m> m^*$ is
nearly equivalent to a full gradient descent iteration (\emph{saturation
regime}).
  Moreover, for the quadratic loss, we derive explicit expressions for the
optimal mini-batch and step size and explicitly characterize the two regimes
above. The critical mini-batch size can be viewed as the limit for effective
mini-batch parallelization. It is also nearly independent of the data size,
implying $O(n)$ acceleration over GD per unit of computation. We give
experimental evidence on real data which closely follows our theoretical
analyses.
  Finally, we show how our results fit in the recent developments in training
deep neural networks and discuss connections to adaptive rates for SGD and
variance reduction.

able to train deep neural networks roughly as well as Q-learning and policy
gradient methods on challenging deep reinforcement learning (RL) problems, but
are much faster (e.g. hours vs. days) because they parallelize better. However,
many RL problems require directed exploration because they have reward
functions that are sparse or deceptive (i.e. contain local optima), and it is
unknown how to encourage such exploration with ES. Here we show that algorithms
that have been invented to promote directed exploration in small-scale evolved
neural networks via populations of exploring agents, specifically novelty
search (NS) and quality diversity (QD) algorithms, can be hybridized with ES to
improve its performance on sparse or deceptive deep RL tasks, while retaining
scalability. Our experiments confirm that the resultant new algorithms, NS-ES
and two QD algorithms, NSR-ES and NSRA-ES, avoid local optima encountered by ES
to achieve higher performance on Atari and simulated robots learning to walk
around a deceptive trap. This paper thus introduces a family of fast, scalable
algorithms for reinforcement learning that are capable of directed exploration.
It also adds this new family of exploration algorithms to the RL toolbox and
raises the interesting possibility that analogous algorithms with multiple
simultaneous paths of exploration might also combine well with existing RL
algorithms outside ES.

has become a popular application nowadays, but most existing solutions can only
work in line-of-sight scenarios, or require regular re-calibration. In this
paper, we propose WiBall, an accurate and calibration-free indoor tracking
system that can work well in non-line-of-sight based on radio signals. WiBall
leverages a stationary and location-independent property of the time-reversal
focusing effect of radio signals for highly accurate moving distance
estimation. Together with the direction estimation based on inertial
measurement unit and location correction using the constraints from the
floorplan, WiBall is shown to be able to track a moving object with
decimeter-level accuracy in different environments. Since WiBall can
accommodate a large number of users with only a single pair of devices, it is
low-cost and easily scalable, and can be a promising candidate for future
indoor tracking applications.

  Gradients",,,,,"cs.NE cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While neuroevolution (evolving neural networks) has a successful track record
across a variety of domains from reinforcement learning to artificial life, it
is rarely applied to large, deep neural networks. A central reason is that
while random mutation generally works in low dimensions, a random perturbation
of thousands or millions of weights is likely to break existing functionality,
providing no learning signal even if some individual weight changes were
beneficial. This paper proposes a solution by introducing a family of safe
mutation (SM) operators that aim within the mutation operator itself to find a
degree of change that does not alter network behavior too much, but still
facilitates exploration. Importantly, these SM operators do not require any
additional interactions with the environment. The most effective SM variant
capitalizes on the intriguing opportunity to scale the degree of mutation of
each individual weight according to the sensitivity of the network's outputs to
that weight, which requires computing the gradient of outputs with respect to
the weights (instead of the gradient of error, as in conventional deep
learning). This safe mutation through gradients (SM-G) operator dramatically
increases the ability of a simple genetic algorithm-based neuroevolution method
to find solutions in high-dimensional domains that require deep and/or
recurrent neural networks (which tend to be particularly brittle to mutation),
including domains that require processing raw pixels. By improving our ability
to evolve deep neural networks, this new safer approach to mutation expands the
scope of domains amenable to neuroevolution.

  Gradient Descent",,,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Because stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has shown promise optimizing neural
networks with millions of parameters and few if any alternatives are known to
exist, it has moved to the heart of leading approaches to reinforcement
learning (RL). For that reason, the recent result from OpenAI showing that a
particular kind of evolution strategy (ES) can rival the performance of
SGD-based deep RL methods with large neural networks provoked surprise. This
result is difficult to interpret in part because of the lingering ambiguity on
how ES actually relates to SGD. The aim of this paper is to significantly
reduce this ambiguity through a series of MNIST-based experiments designed to
uncover their relationship. As a simple supervised problem without domain noise
(unlike in most RL), MNIST makes it possible (1) to measure the correlation
between gradients computed by ES and SGD and (2) then to develop an SGD-based
proxy that accurately predicts the performance of different ES population
sizes. These innovations give a new level of insight into the real capabilities
of ES, and lead also to some unconventional means for applying ES to supervised
problems that shed further light on its differences from SGD. Incorporating
these lessons, the paper concludes by demonstrating that ES can achieve 99%
accuracy on MNIST, a number higher than any previously published result for any
evolutionary method. While not by any means suggesting that ES should
substitute for SGD in supervised learning, the suite of experiments herein
enables more informed decisions on the application of ES within RL and other
paradigms.

is calculated both before and after the electroweak phase transition (EWPT). In
the Standard Model before EWPT, the leptogenesis is well known to be driven by
the abelian anomaly in a massless hypercharge field. The generation of the
neutrino asymmetry in the Higgs phase after EWPT, in its turn, has not been
considered previously because of the absence of any quantum anomaly in an
external electromagnetic field for such electroneutral particles as neutrino,
unlike the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly for charged left and right polarized
massless electrons in the same electromagnetic field. Using the neutrino
Boltzmann equation, modified by the Berry curvature term in the momentum space,
we establish the violation of the macroscopic neutrino current in plasma after
EWPT and exactly reproduce the nonconservation of the lepton current in the
symmetric phase before EWPT arising in quantum field theory due to the nonzero
lepton hypercharge and corresponding triangle anomaly in an external
hypercharge field. In the last case, the non-conservation of the lepton current
is derived through the kinetic approach without a computation of corresponding
Feynman diagrams. Then the new kinetic equation is applied for the calculation
of the neutrino asymmetry accounting for the Berry curvature and the
electroweak interaction with background fermions in the Higgs phase. Such an
interaction generates a neutrino asymmetry through the electroweak coupling of
neutrino currents with electromagnetic fields in plasma, which is $\sim
G_\mathrm{F}^2$. It turns out that this effect is especially efficient for
maximally helical magnetic fields.

gradient-based learning algorithms, namely backpropagation. Evolution
strategies (ES) can rival backprop-based algorithms such as Q-learning and
policy gradients on challenging deep reinforcement learning (RL) problems.
However, ES can be considered a gradient-based algorithm because it performs
stochastic gradient descent via an operation similar to a finite-difference
approximation of the gradient. That raises the question of whether
non-gradient-based evolutionary algorithms can work at DNN scales. Here we
demonstrate they can: we evolve the weights of a DNN with a simple,
gradient-free, population-based genetic algorithm (GA) and it performs well on
hard deep RL problems, including Atari and humanoid locomotion. The Deep GA
successfully evolves networks with over four million free parameters, the
largest neural networks ever evolved with a traditional evolutionary algorithm.
These results (1) expand our sense of the scale at which GAs can operate, (2)
suggest intriguingly that in some cases following the gradient is not the best
choice for optimizing performance, and (3) make immediately available the
multitude of neuroevolution techniques that improve performance. We demonstrate
the latter by showing that combining DNNs with novelty search, which encourages
exploration on tasks with deceptive or sparse reward functions, can solve a
high-dimensional problem on which reward-maximizing algorithms (e.g.\ DQN, A3C,

evolution strategy recently attracted attention because it performs
surprisingly well in challenging deep reinforcement learning domains. It
searches for neural network parameters by generating perturbations to the
current set of parameters, checking their performance, and moving in the
aggregate direction of higher reward. Because it resembles a traditional
finite-difference approximation of the reward gradient, it can naturally be
confused with one. However, this ES optimizes for a different gradient than
just reward: It optimizes for the average reward of the entire population,
thereby seeking parameters that are robust to perturbation. This difference can
channel ES into distinct areas of the search space relative to gradient
descent, and also consequently to networks with distinct properties. This
unique robustness-seeking property, and its consequences for optimization, are
demonstrated in several domains. They include humanoid locomotion, where
networks from policy gradient-based reinforcement learning are significantly

would be incompatible with present observations. In this paper, we critically
review those constraints and find several caveats on the analysis. First of
all, the constraints on the fraction $\alpha$ of PBH in matter seem to be
driven by a very restrictive choice of priors on the cosmological parameters.
In particular, the degeneracy between $\Omega_{\rm M}$ and $\alpha$ is ignored
and thus, by fixing $\Omega_{\rm M}$, transferred the constraining power of SN
magnitudes to $\alpha$. Furthermore, by considering more realistic physical
sizes for the type-Ia supernovae, we find an effect on the SN lensing
magnification distribution that leads to significantly looser constraints.
Moreover, considering a wide mass spectrum of PBH, such as a lognormal
distribution, further softens the constraints from SN lensing. Finally, we find
that the fraction of PBH that could constitute DM today is bounded by $f_{\rm
PBH} < 1.09\ (1.38)$, for JLA (Union 2.1) catalogs, and thus it is perfectly
compatible with an all-PBH dark matter scenario in the LIGO band.

start by obtaining the hitherto overlooked dissipative interaction of a domain
wall and its quantum magnon bath to linear order in the domain-wall velocity
and to quadratic order in magnon fields. An exact expression for the pertinent
scattering matrix is obtained with the aid of supersymmetric quantum mechanics.
We then derive the magnon-induced frictional force on a domain wall in two
different frameworks: time-dependent perturbation theory in quantum mechanics
and the Keldysh formalism, which yield identical results. The latter, in
particular, allows us to verify the fluctuation-dissipation theorem explicitly
by providing both the frictional force and the correlator of the associated
stochastic Langevin force. The potential for magnons induced by a domain wall
is reflectionless, and thus the resultant frictional force is non-Markovian
similarly to the case of solitons in superfluids. They share an intriguing
connection to the Abraham-Lorentz force that is well-known for its causality
paradox. The dynamical responses of a domain wall are studied under a few
simple circumstances, where the non-Markovian nature of the frictional force
can be probed experimentally. Our work, in conjunction with the previous study

the up-to-date upper and lower bounds on the EBL intensity. The posterior
distributions built with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method are used to
determine an allowed range of the individual parameters of the model.
Consequently, the star formation rate multiplication factor is constrained in
the range $1.01 < C_{\mbox{sfr}} < 1.69$ at $68\%$ C.L. The method also results
in the bounds on the lifetime, radius, dust particle density and opacity of the
molecular clouds that have large ambiguity otherwise. It is shown that there is
a reasonable agreement between the model and the intensity bounds while the
astrophysical parameters of the best fit model are close to their estimates
from literature.

connectivity to ground users in rural areas by establishing line-of-sight (LoS)

exploiting an interference alignment (IA) technique, a novel method for
achieving the maximum sum-rate in HAP-based communications without CSI is
proposed. In particular, to realize IA, a multiple-antenna tethered balloon is
used as a relay between multiple HAP drones and ground stations (GSs). Here, a
multiple-input multiple-output X network system is considered. The capacity of
the considered M*N X network with a tethered balloon relay is derived in
closed-form. Simulation results corroborate the theoretical findings and show
that the proposed approach yields the maximum sum-rate in multiple HAPs-GSs

optimal balloon's altitude for which the sum-rate is maximized.

the great scientific value of the LHC physics program. The next phase of this
global scientific project will be the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) which will
collect data starting circa 2026 and continue into the 2030's. The primary
science goal is to search for physics beyond the SM and, should it be

ATLAS and CMS experiments will record circa 10 times as much data from 100
times as many collisions as in LHC Run 1. The NSF and the DOE are planning
large investments in detector upgrades so the HL-LHC can operate in this
high-rate environment. A commensurate investment in R&D for the software for
acquiring, managing, processing and analyzing HL-LHC data will be critical to
maximize the return-on-investment in the upgraded accelerator and detectors.

simple scaling law, ranging from dwarf galaxies to galaxy clusters, with a weak
dependence on their virial mass. Here we point out that this can not only be
used to provide a method to determine the standard relation between halo mass
and concentration, but also to use large samples of objects in order to place
constraints on dark matter self-interactions that can be more robust than
constraints derived from individual objects. We demonstrate our method by
considering a sample of about 50 objects distributed across the whole halo mass
range, and by modelling the effect of self-interactions in a way similar to
what has been previously done in the literature. Using additional input from
simulations then results in a constraint on the self-interaction cross section
per unit dark matter mass of about $\sigma/m_\chi\lesssim 0.3$ cm$^2$/g. We
expect that these constraints can be significantly improved in the future, and
made more robust, by i) an improved modelling of the effect of
self-interactions, both theoretical and by comparison with simulations, ii)
taking into account a larger sample of objects and iii) by reducing the
currently still relatively large uncertainties that we conservatively assign to
the surface densities of individual objects. The latter can be achieved in
particular by using kinematic observations to directly constrain the average
halo mass inside a given radius, rather than fitting the data to a pre-selected
profile and then reconstruct the mass. For a velocity-independent
cross-section, our current result is formally already somewhat smaller than the
range $0.5-5$ cm$^2$/g that has been invoked to explain potential
inconsistencies between small-scale observations and expectations in the
standard collisionless cold dark matter paradigm.

Hamiltonian or an action, it is relatively straightforward to obtain the
non-relativistic quantum mechanics (NRQM) of the system. These standard
procedures, based on either the Hamiltonian or the path integral, however, do
not work in the case of a relativistic particle. As a result we do not have a
single particle description of relativistic quantum mechanics (RQM). Instead,
the correct approach requires a transmutation of dynamical variables from the
position and momentum of a single particle to a field and its canonical
momentum. Particles, along with antiparticles, reappear in a very non-trivial
manner as the excitations of the field. The fact that one needs to adopt
completely different languages to describe relativistic and non-relativistic
free particle implies that obtaining the NRQM limit of QFT is conceptually
non-trivial. I examine this limit in several approaches (like, for e.g.,
Hamiltonian dynamics, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian path integrals, field
theoretic description etc.) and identify the precise issues which arise when
one attempts to obtain the NRQM from QFT in each of these approaches. The
dichotomy of description between NRQM and QFT does not originate just from the
square root in the Hamiltonian or from the demand of Lorentz invariance, as it
is sometimes claimed. The real difficulty has its origin in the necessary
existence of antiparticles to ensure a particular notion of relativistic
causality. Because of these conceptual issues, it turns out that one cannot, in
fact, obtain some of the popular descriptions of NRQM by any sensible limiting
procedure applied to QFT. To obtain NRQM from QFT in a seamless manner, it is
necessary to work with NRQM expressed in a language closer to that of QFT.

Therefore, it is a good candidate to study the relationship between coronal
X-ray and disc UV emission. However, we find no correlation between the X-ray

strong X-ray variability and the variable part of the UV spectrum being
consistent with irradiation of a standard thin disc. This means either that the
X-ray flux which irradiates the UV emitting outer disc does not correlate with
the X-ray flux in our line of sight and/or that another process drives the
majority of the UV variability. The former case may be due to changes in
coronal geometry, absorption or scattering between the corona and the disc.

cluster detection efficiency when compared to using only one of these probes,
since both probe the same medium: the hot ionized gas of the intra-cluster

detecting galaxy clusters from SZ and X-ray surveys. This method builds on a
previously proposed joint X-ray-SZ extraction method (Tarr\'io et al. 2016) and
allows to blindly detect clusters, that is finding new clusters without knowing
their position, size or redshift, by searching on SZ and X-ray maps
simultaneously. The proposed method is tested using data from the ROSAT all-sky
survey and from the Planck survey. The evaluation is done by comparison with
existing cluster catalogues in the area of the sky covered by the deep SPT
survey. Thanks to the addition of the X-ray information, the joint detection
method is able to achieve simultaneously better purity, better detection
efficiency and better position accuracy than its predecessor Planck MMF, which
is based on SZ maps only. For a purity of 85%, the X-ray-SZ method detects 141
confirmed clusters in the SPT region, whereas to detect the same number of
confirmed clusters with Planck MMF, we would need to decrease its purity to
70%. We provide a catalogue of 225 sources selected by the proposed method in
the SPT footprint, with masses ranging between 0.7 and 14.5 $\cdot 10^{14}$

theories relevant for single and multilayer graphene, type-I and type-II Weyl

anti-commutes with the effective Hamiltonian while leaving the interaction

steadily increase with redshift during the peak epoch of massive galaxy
development ($1{\leq}z{\leq}3$). We use close-pair statistics to objectively
study the incidence of massive galaxies (stellar
$M_{1}{\geq}2{\times}10^{10}M_{\odot}$) hosting major companions
($1{\leq}M_{1}/M_{2}{\leq}4$; i.e., $<$4:1) at six epochs spanning $0{<}z{<}3$.
We select companions from a nearly complete, mass-limited
($\geq5{\times}10^{9}M_{\odot}$) sample of 23,696 galaxies in the five CANDELS
fields and the SDSS. Using $5-50$ kpc projected separation and close redshift
proximity criteria, we find that the major companion fraction
$f_{\mathrm{mc}}(z)$ based on stellar mass-ratio (MR) selection increases from
6% ($z{\sim}0$) to 16% ($z{\sim}0.8$), then turns over at $z{\sim}1$ and
decreases to 7% ($z{\sim}3$). Instead, if we use a major F160W flux ratio (FR)
selection, we find that $f_{\mathrm{mc}}(z)$ increases steadily until $z=3$
owing to increasing contamination from minor (MR$>$4:1) companions at $z>1$. We
show that these evolutionary trends are statistically robust to changes in
companion proximity. We find disagreements between published results are
resolved when selection criteria are closely matched. If we compute merger
rates using constant fraction-to-rate conversion factors
($C_{\mathrm{merg,pair}}{=}0.6$ and
$T_{\mathrm{obs,pair}}{=}0.65\mathrm{Gyr}$), we find that MR rates disagree
with theoretical predictions at $z{>}1.5$. Instead, if we use an evolving
$T_{\mathrm{obs,pair}}(z){\propto}(1+z)^{-2}$ from Snyder et al., our MR-based
rates agree with theory at $0{<}z{<}3$. Our analysis underscores the need for
detailed calibration of $C_{\mathrm{merg,pair}}$ and $T_{\mathrm{obs,pair}}$ as
a function of redshift, mass and companion selection criteria to better

Accepted for publication in PASJ",,"10.1093/pasj/psy004",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The present paper investigates the temperature structure of the X-ray
emitting plasma in the core of the Perseus cluster using the 1.8--20.0 keV data
obtained with the Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS) onboard the Hitomi Observatory.
A series of four observations were carried out, with a total effective exposure
time of 338 ks and covering a central region $\sim7'$ in diameter. The SXS was
operated with an energy resolution of $\sim$5 eV (full width at half maximum)
at 5.9 keV. Not only fine structures of K-shell lines in He-like ions but also
transitions from higher principal quantum numbers are clearly resolved from Si
through Fe. This enables us to perform temperature diagnostics using the line
ratios of Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe, and to provide the first direct measurement of
the excitation temperature and ionization temperature in the Perseus cluster.
The observed spectrum is roughly reproduced by a single temperature thermal
plasma model in collisional ionization equilibrium, but detailed line ratio
diagnostics reveal slight deviations from this approximation. In particular,
the data exhibit an apparent trend of increasing ionization temperature with
increasing atomic mass, as well as small differences between the ionization and
excitation temperatures for Fe, the only element for which both temperatures
can be measured. The best-fit two-temperature models suggest a combination of 3
and 5 keV gas, which is consistent with the idea that the observed small
deviations from a single temperature approximation are due to the effects of
projection of the known radial temperature gradient in the cluster core along
the line of sight. Comparison with the Chandra/ACIS and the XMM-Newton/RGS
results on the other hand suggests that additional lower-temperature components
are present in the ICM but not detectable by Hitomi SXS given its 1.8--20 keV
energy band.

resulting mean vertical motion $\overline{W}$ shows a linear increase with both
$V_\phi$ and $L_z$ at $10 \sigma$ significance. Such a trend is expected from
and consistent with the known Galactic warp. This signal extends to stars with
guiding centre radii $R_g<R_0$, placing the onset of the warp at
$R\lesssim7{\rm kpc}$. At equally high significance, we detect a previously
unknown wave-like pattern of $\overline{W}$ over guiding centre $R_g$ with
amplitude $\sim1{\rm kms}^{-1}$ and wavelength $\sim2.5{\rm kpc}$. This pattern
is present in both the centre and anti-centre directions, consistent with a
winding (corrugated) warp or bending wave, likely related to known features in
the outer disc (TriAnd and Monoceros over-densities), and may be caused by the
interaction with the Sgr dwarf galaxy $\sim1{\rm Gyr}$ ago. The only
significant deviation from this simple fit is a stream-like feature near
$R_g\sim9{\rm kpc}$ ($|L_z|\sim2150{\rm kpckms}^{-1}$).

(squared) frequency $\omega^2(t)$ occurs in the modelling of several physical
systems. It is generally believed that systems, with $m(t)>0$ and
$\omega^2(t)>0$ (normal oscillator) are stable while systems with $m(t)>0$ and
$\omega^2(t)<0$ (inverted oscillator) are unstable. We show that it is possible
to represent the \textit{same} physical system either as a normal oscillator or
as an inverted oscillator by redefinition of dynamical variables. While we
expect the physics to be invariant under such redefinitions, it is not obvious
how this invariance actually comes about. We study the relation between these
two, normal and inverted, representations of an oscillator in detail both in
Heisenberg and Schr\""{o}dinger pictures to clarify several conceptual and
technical issues. The situation becomes more involved when the oscillator is
coupled to another (semi)classical degree of freedom $C(t)$ and we want to
study the back-reaction of the quantum system $q(t)$ on $C(t)$, in the
semi-classical approximation. We provide a simple prescription for the
back-reaction based on energy conservation and study that the dynamics of the
full system in both normal and the inverted oscillator representation. The
physics again remains invariant but there are some extra subtleties which we
clarify. The implications of these results for quantum field theory in
cosmological backgrounds are discussed briefly in an appendix.

gas content help us understand how such marginal galaxies survive and form
stars. We present deep neutral hydrogen (HI) observations from the Westerbork
Synthesis Radio Telescope in order to understand its HI distribution and
potential for star formation. We find a larger HI line flux than the previously
accepted value, resulting in a 50% larger HI mass of 4.1 x 10^5 Msun. The
additional HI flux is from low surface brightness emission that was previously
missed; with careful masking this emission can be recovered even in shallower
data. We perform a Gaussian spectral decomposition to find a cool neutral
medium component (CNM) with a mass of 3.7 x 10^4 Msun, or almost 10% of the
total HI mass. Leo T has no HI emission extending from the main HI body, but
there is evidence of interaction with the Milky Way circumgalactic medium in
both a potential truncation of the HI body and the offset of the peak HI
distribution from the optical center. The CNM component of Leo T is large when
compared to other dwarf galaxies, even though Leo T is not currently forming
stars and has a lower star formation efficiency than other gas-rich dwarf

the history of the planetary system. Exoplanets orbiting close to cool stars
are expected to be on circular, aligned orbits because of strong tidal
interactions with the stellar convective envelope. Spin-orbit alignment can be
measured when the planet transits its star, but such ground-based spectroscopic
measurements are challenging for cool, slowly-rotating stars. Here we report
the characterization of a planet three-dimensional trajectory around an M dwarf
star, derived by mapping the spectrum of the stellar photosphere along the
chord transited by the planet. We find that the eccentric orbit of the
Neptune-mass exoplanet GJ 436b is nearly perpendicular to the stellar equator.
Both eccentricity and misalignment, surprising around a cool star, can result
from dynamical interactions (via Kozai migration) with a yet-undetected outer
companion. This inward migration of GJ 436b could have triggered the
atmospheric escape that now sustains its giant exosphere. Eccentric, misaligned
exoplanets orbiting close to cool stars might thus hint at the presence of
unseen perturbers and illustrate the diversity of orbital architectures seen in
exoplanetary systems.

The packet gives natural relativistic generalization of non relativistic
Gaussian wave packet but it contains covariant states of particle
(antiparticle) only with positive (negative) energy sign and propagates without
their mixing and without changing of its relativistically invariant width. For
the diagrammatic treatment of oscillation with the use of these wave packets
for external particles, the notion of covariant composite wave function for

oscillation pictures, giving an effective language for detailed description of
this process, and resolves the problems with causality and with covariant equal

asymptotic behaviour in narrow-packets approximation naturally conforms with
such approximation of one-packet state and with the asymptotic behaviour of

systems, including deep neural networks (DNNs), is adversarial learning
attacks. We analyze possible test-time evasion-attack mechanisms and show that,
in some important cases, when the image has been attacked, correctly
classifying it has no utility: i) when the image to be attacked is (even
arbitrarily) selected from the attacker's cache; ii) when the sole recipient of
the classifier's decision is the attacker. Moreover, in some application
domains and scenarios it is highly actionable to detect the attack irrespective
of correctly classifying in the face of it (with classification still performed
if no attack is detected). We hypothesize that, even if human-imperceptible,
adversarial perturbations are machine-detectable. We propose a purely
unsupervised anomaly detector (AD) that, unlike previous works: i) models the
joint density of a deep layer using highly suitable null hypothesis density
models (matched in particular to the non- negative support for RELU layers);

25 of the clusters are fairly young massive clusters (YMCs) with ages of
hundreds of Myr, and 16 appear to be older, globular clusters (GCs). There are
at least four GCs with best fit ages of approximately 1-3 Gyr and eight with
best fit ages of approximately 5-10 Gyr. The mean metallicity of the YMCs is
[Fe/H] of approximately -0.1 and for the GCs is [Fe/H] of approximately -0.9.
We find a near-continuous spread in both age and metallicity for our sample,
which may indicate that M101 had a more-or-less continuous history of cluster
and star formation. From the kinematics, we find that the YMCs rotate with the
HI gas fairly well, while the GCs do not. We cannot definitively say whether
the GCs sampled here lie in an inner halo, thick disk, or bulge/psuedobulge
component, although given the very small bulge in M101, the last seems
unlikely. The kinematics and ages of the YMCs suggest that M101 may have
undergone heating of its disk or possibly a continuous merger/accretion history

electricity-to-light conversion in solar cells (SCs). Therefore, quantitative
analysis and reduction of surface recombination is an important direction in SC
research. In this work, electroluminescence (EL) intensity and photoconversion
efficiency of a set of 93 large-area (239\,cm$^2$) a-Si:H/c-Si heterojunction
SCs (HJSCs) are measured under AM1.5 conditions at 298 K. The HJSC samples
differed only in surface recombination velocity, $S$, but otherwise were
identical. Variation in $S$ was due to the variation of the chemical conditions
under which the samples were treated. It is established that EL quantum
efficiency, is affected by $S$ much more strongly than photoconversion
efficiency, $\eta$: namely, the reduction of the latter from 20.5\% to 18\% due
to an increase of $S$ is accompanied by a decrease of the former by more than
an order of magnitude. In HJSCs with well passivated surfaces, i.e. low $S$, EL
efficiency reached 2.1\%, which is notably higher than the known values in
silicon homojunction diodes. For temperature-dependent measurements of EL and
dark I-V curves, one of the samples was cut into small-area (1 cm$^2$) pieces.
It was found that EL intensity as a function of temperature develops a maximum
at $T$ = 223 K. At low temperatures, the current at weak bias is shown to be
due to tunneling mechanism. A theoretical model is developed that explains all
these findings quantitatively.

  Digital Pathology",,,,,"cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Digital pathology is not only one of the most promising fields of diagnostic
medicine, but at the same time a hot topic for fundamental research. Digital
pathology is not just the transfer of histopathological slides into digital
representations. The combination of different data sources (images, patient
records, and *omics data) together with current advances in artificial
intelligence/machine learning enable to make novel information accessible and
quantifiable to a human expert, which is not yet available and not exploited in
current medical settings. The grand goal is to reach a level of usable
intelligence to understand the data in the context of an application task,
thereby making machine decisions transparent, interpretable and explainable.
The foundation of such an ""augmented pathologist"" needs an integrated approach:
While machine learning algorithms require many thousands of training examples,
a human expert is often confronted with only a few data points. Interestingly,
humans can learn from such few examples and are able to instantly interpret
complex patterns. Consequently, the grand goal is to combine the possibilities
of artificial intelligence with human intelligence and to find a well-suited
balance between them to enable what neither of them could do on their own. This
can raise the quality of education, diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of
cancer and other diseases. In this paper we describe some (incomplete) research
issues which we believe should be addressed in an integrated and concerted
effort for paving the way towards the augmented pathologist.

of machine learning and data mining as most real life datasets are imbalanced.
Several existing machine learning algorithms try to maximize the accuracy
classification by correctly identifying majority class samples while ignoring
the minority class. However, the concept of the minority class instances
usually represents a higher interest than the majority class. Recently, several
cost sensitive methods, ensemble models and sampling techniques have been used
in literature in order to classify imbalance datasets. In this paper, we
propose MEBoost, a new boosting algorithm for imbalanced datasets. MEBoost
mixes two different weak learners with boosting to improve the performance on
imbalanced datasets. MEBoost is an alternative to the existing techniques such
as SMOTEBoost, RUSBoost, Adaboost, etc. The performance of MEBoost has been
evaluated on 12 benchmark imbalanced datasets with state of the art ensemble
methods like SMOTEBoost, RUSBoost, Easy Ensemble, EUSBoost, DataBoost.
Experimental results show significant improvement over the other methods and it
can be concluded that MEBoost is an effective and promising algorithm to deal
with imbalance datasets. The python version of the code is available here:

going through an epoch of violent activity in all wavelengths ranging from
radio to $\gamma$-rays. The multiwavelength variability timescale favors a
compact emission region, most likely originating in a jet outflow, for both
observing epochs presented in this work. The simultaneous INTEGRAL/Imager on
Board the Integral Satellite (IBIS) 20--40 keV light curve obtained during the
June 27 observing run correlates very strongly with the optical light curve,
with no detectable delay between the optical bands as well as between the
optical and hard X-rays. The average slope of the dereddened spectral energy
distribution was roughly flat between the $I_C$- and $V$-bands during the June
27 run, even though the optical and X-ray flux varied by $>$25$\times$ during
the run, ruling out an irradiation origin for the optical and suggesting that
the optically thick to optically thin jet synchrotron break during the
observations was at a frequency larger than that of $V$-band, which is quite
extreme for X-ray binaries. These observations suggest that the optical
emission originated very close to the base of the jet. A strong H$\alpha$
emission line, probably originating in a quasi-spherical nebula around the
source, also contributes significantly in the $R_C$-band. Our data, in
conjunction with contemporaneous data at other wavelengths presented by other
groups, strongly suggest that the jet-base was extremely compact and energetic
during this phase of the outburst.

the interaction is of order $|x|^{1-\alpha}$ with $\alpha\in ]1,a]$. In the
case $\alpha\in (1,a)$ we give a complete propagation of chaos result, proving
the $\Gamma$-l.s.c property of the fractional Fisher information, already known
for the classical Fisher information, using a result of Mischler and Hauray. In
the fair competition case $a=\alpha$, we only prove a convergence/consistency
result in a sub-critical mass regime, similarly as the result obtained for the
classical Keller-Segel equation.

  Detection and Density Estimation","CVPR 2018",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In real-world crowd counting applications, the crowd densities vary greatly
in spatial and temporal domains. A detection based counting method will
estimate crowds accurately in low density scenes, while its reliability in
congested areas is downgraded. A regression based approach, on the other hand,
captures the general density information in crowded regions. Without knowing
the location of each person, it tends to overestimate the count in low density
areas. Thus, exclusively using either one of them is not sufficient to handle
all kinds of scenes with varying densities. To address this issue, a novel
end-to-end crowd counting framework, named DecideNet (DEteCtIon and Density
Estimation Network) is proposed. It can adaptively decide the appropriate
counting mode for different locations on the image based on its real density
conditions. DecideNet starts with estimating the crowd density by generating
detection and regression based density maps separately. To capture inevitable
variation in densities, it incorporates an attention module, meant to
adaptively assess the reliability of the two types of estimations. The final
crowd counts are obtained with the guidance of the attention module to adopt
suitable estimations from the two kinds of density maps. Experimental results
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging
crowd counting datasets.

tractable algorithms for bounded expansion classes may offer a promising

achieves run times competitive with a popular algorithm for subgraph

empirically identify two particular ways in which future theoretical advances
could alleviate bottlenecks in the algorithmic pipeline.

weaker increase of their size as a function of the field until some critical

hysteretic behavior with coexistence of small and large radius skyrmions and
small energy barriers between them. The first case is also characterized by a
strong dependence of the skyrmion radius on the dot diameter, while in the

tic scales. We used results from smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)
simulations from which we extracted physical parameters that are used as inputs
for our full gas-grain chemical model. In these simulations, the evolution of
the interstellar matter is followed for ~50 Myr. The warm low-density
interstellar medium gas flows into spiral arms where orbit crowding produces
the shock formation of dense clouds, which are held together temporarily by the
external pressure. Results. We show that depending on the physical history of
each SPH particle, the molecular composition of the modeled dense clouds
presents a high dispersion in the computed abundances even if the local
physical properties are similar. We find that carbon chains are the most
affected species and show that these differences are directly connected to
differences in (1) the electronic fraction, (2) the C/O ratio, and (3) the
local physical conditions. We argue that differences in the dynamical evolution
of the gas that formed dense clouds could account for the molecular diversity
observed between and within these clouds. Conclusions. This study shows the
importance of past physical conditions in establishing the chemical composition

and spectral traces.
  We pose the central question: whenever the relevant products, $AB$, $BA$ lie
in an ideal, do bounded operators $A$, $B$ always commute under any trace on
that ideal, i.e.,$\tau(AB) = \tau(BA)$? And if not, characterize which

flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). It is therefore important to develop
efficient methods for constructing flux-rope configurations constrained by
observed magnetic data and the morphology of the pre-eruptive source region.
For this purpose, we have derived and implemented a compact analytical form
that represents the magnetic field of a thin flux rope with an axis of
arbitrary shape and circular cross-sections. This form implies that the flux
rope carries axial current $I$ and axial flux $F$, so that the respective
magnetic field is the curl of the sum of axial and azimuthal vector potentials
proportional to $I$ and $F$, respectively. We expressed the vector potentials
in terms of modified Biot-Savart laws whose kernels are regularized at the axis
in such a way that, when the axis is straight, these laws define a cylindrical
force-free flux rope with a parabolic profile for the axial current density.
For the cases we have studied so far, we determined the shape of the rope axis
by following the polarity inversion line of the eruptions' source region, using
observed magnetograms. The height variation along the axis and other flux-rope
parameters are estimated by means of potential field extrapolations. Using this
heuristic approach, we were able to construct pre-eruption configurations for
the 2009 February 13 and 2011 October 1 CME events. These applications
demonstrate the flexibility and efficiency of our new method for energizing
pre-eruptive configurations in simulations of CMEs.

This material undergoes a phase transition at 240K that changes the structure

coordinated EV charging strategy presented in this paper, each aggregator
determines EV charging start time and charging energy profiles to minimize
overall EV charging energy cost by including consideration of the actions of
the neighboring aggregators. The competitive interactions of the aggregators
are modeled by developing a two-stage non-cooperative game among the
aggregators. The game is then studied under prospect theory to examine the
impacts of non-ideal actions of the aggregators in selecting EV charging start
times according to subjectively evaluating their opponents' actions. It is
shown that the non-cooperative interactions among the aggregators lead to a
subgame perfect $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium when the game is played with either
ideal, or non-ideal, actions of the aggregators. A case study presented
demonstrates that the benefits of the coordinated EV charging strategy, in
terms of energy cost savings and peak-to-average ratio reductions, are
significantly resilient to non-ideal actions of the aggregators.

confirmed the existence of Sn in the starting high purity BP crystals purchased

Independent of QW geometry parameters, alloy disorder leads to a strong

red shift in the ground-state transition wavelength. Polarisation-resolved
optical transition strengths exhibit a striking effect of disorder, where the
inhomogeneous broadening could exceed an order of magnitude for MQWs, in
comparison to a factor of about three for single quantum wells. The strong
influence of alloy disorder effects persists when small variations in the size

brief flyby and faintness made it difficult to study. Two remarkable properties
are its large (up to 2.5 mag) rotational variability and its motion relative to
the Sun before encounter. The former suggests an extremely elongated shape
(aspect ratio ~10) and the latter an origin from the protoplanetary disk of a
young star in a nearby association. Against expectations, it is also not
comet-like. 1I/`Oumuamua's variability can also be explained if it is a contact
binary composed of near-equilibrium ellipsoidal components and heterogeneous
surfaces, i.e. brighter, dust-mantled inner-facing hemispheres and darker,
dust-free outer-facing poles. Such shapes are a plausible outcome of radiation,
tides and collisions in systems where planets are clearing planetesimal disks.
The probability that 1I/`Oumuamua has the same motion as a young (<~100 Myr)
stellar association by coincidence is <1%. If it is young, its detection vs.
more numerous, older counterparts could be explained as a selection effect due
to darkening of surfaces by Galactic cosmic rays and loss of dust.
1I/`Oumuamua's apparent lack of ices can be explained if ejected rocky
planetesimals are characteristically smaller and thus far more numerous than
their icy counterparts: the Solar System may currently host several such
objects captured by the combined gravity of Jupiter and the Sun.

increased temperature and charge conductivity, which corroborates the intrinsic

simultaneously reach 1130 S cm-1 and 20%, respectively, an order of magnitude
larger than typical magnetic systems. Combining the Kagome-lattice structure

problem into a bi-objective optimization problem whose solution set contains
solutions of the original multiple-choice knapsack problem. The method relies
on solving a series of suitably defined linearly scalarized bi-objective
problems. The novelty which makes the method attractive from the computational
point of view is that we are able to solve explicitly those linearly scalarized
bi-objective problems with the help of the closed-form formulae. The method is
computationally analyzed on a set of large-scale problem instances (test
problems) of two categories: uncorrelated and weakly correlated. Computational
results show that after solving, in average 10 scalarized bi-objective
problems, the optimal value of the original knapsack problem is approximated
with the accuracy comparable to the accuracies obtained by the greedy algorithm
and an exact algorithm. More importantly, the respective approximate solution
to the original knapsack problem (for which the approximate optimal value is
attained) can be found without resorting to the dynamic programming. In the
test problems, the number of multiple-choice constraints ranges up to hundreds
with hundreds variables in each constraint.

order at around $x$ = 0.4, but leaves a local secondary magnetic order up to
$x\sim 0.8$ with a slight decrease in its transition temperature. The

these two processes by taking various flavor observables into account. It is
found that significant mixing between the vector-like and the second generation

Theory (IIT) hypothesizes that the amount of integrated information ($\Phi$) in

quantify information integration in a system as a whole, integrated information
should be measured across the partition of the system at which information loss
caused by partitioning is minimized, called the Minimum Information Partition
(MIP). The computational cost for exhaustively searching for the MIP grows
exponentially with system size, making it difficult to apply IIT to real neural
data. It has been previously shown that if a measure of $\Phi$ satisfies a
mathematical property, submodularity, the MIP can be found in a polynomial
order by an optimization algorithm. However, although the first version of
$\Phi$ is submodular, the later versions are not. In this study, we empirically
explore to what extent the algorithm can be applied to the non-submodular
measures of $\Phi$ by evaluating the accuracy of the algorithm in simulated
data and real neural data. We find that the algorithm identifies the MIP in a
nearly perfect manner even for the non-submodular measures. Our results show
that the algorithm allows us to measure $\Phi$ in large systems within a

the sample size goes to infinity and the number of items keeps fixed.
Consequently, in the psychometrics literature, this estimator is less preferred

re-investigate the JML estimator for high-dimensional exploratory item factor

we establish a notion of statistical consistency for a constrained JML

stochastic optimal control problems governed by partial differential equations
(PDEs). If the optimal control problems involve uncertainty, we need to use a
few random variables to parameterize the uncertainty. The stochastic optimal
control problems require solving coupled optimality system for a large number
of samples in the stochastic space to quantify the statistics of the system
response and explore the uncertainty quantification. Thus the computation is
prohibitively expensive. To overcome the difficulty, model reduction is
necessary to significantly reduce the computation complexity. We exploit the
advantages from both reduced basis method and Generalized Multiscale Finite
Element Method (GMsFEM) and develop the local-global model reduction method for
stochastic optimal control problems with PDE constraints. This local-global
model reduction can achieve much more computation efficiency than using only
local model reduction approach and only global model reduction approach. We
recast the stochastic optimal problems in the framework of saddle-point
problems and analyze the existence and uniqueness of the optimal solutions of
the reduced model. In the local-global approach, most of computation steps are
independent of each other. This is very desirable for scientific computation.
Moreover, the online computation for each random sample is very fast via the
proposed model reduction method. This allows us to compute the optimality
system for a large number of samples. To demonstrate the performance of the
local-global model reduction method, a few numerical examples are provided for
different stochastic optimal control problems.

insulator coupled to the Chern-Simons gauge field. The observed non-uniform CSL
has a substantial effect on a nearby free-fermion environment. We show that, in
the presence of arbitrarily small spin exchange interaction, the CSL can endow
a gauge-field-modulated effective interaction between the environmental
fermions. The induced effective interaction can be attractive within a
significant parameter region, leading to an instability towards d-wave
superconductivity in the fermionic bath.

the bounded space online $d$-hypercube bin packing problem, solving an open
question raised in 2005. In the classic $d$-hypercube bin packing problem, we
are given a sequence of $d$-dimensional hypercubes and we have an unlimited
number of bins, each of which is a $d$-dimensional unit hypercube. The goal is
to pack (orthogonally) the given hypercubes into the minimum possible number of
bins, in such a way that no two hypercubes in the same bin overlap. The bounded
space online $d$-hypercube bin packing problem is a variant of the
$d$-hypercube bin packing problem, in which the hypercubes arrive online and
each one must be packed in an open bin without the knowledge of the next
hypercubes. Moreover, at each moment, only a constant number of open bins are
allowed (whenever a new bin is used, it is considered open, and it remains so
until it is considered closed, in which case, it is not allowed to accept new
hypercubes). Epstein and van Stee [SIAM J. Comput. 35 (2005), no. 2, 431-448]
showed that $\rho$ is $\Omega(\log d)$ and $O(d/\log d)$, and conjectured that
it is $\Theta(\log d)$. We show that $\rho$ is in fact $\Theta(d/\log d)$. To
obtain this result, we elaborate on some ideas presented by those authors, and
go one step further showing how to obtain better (offline) packings of certain
special instances for which one knows how many bins any bounded space algorithm
has to use. Our main contribution establishes the existence of such packings,
for large enough $d$, using probabilistic arguments. Such packings also lead to
lower bounds for the prices of anarchy of the selfish $d$-hypercube bin packing
game. We present a lower bound of $\Omega(d/\log d)$ for the pure price of
anarchy of this game, and we also give a lower bound of $\Omega(\log d)$ for
its strong price of anarchy.

the observation of ferromagnetic ordering in III-V (Ga,Mn)As films. Recently, a
series of DMS compounds isostructural to iron-based superconductors have been
reported. Among them, the highest Curie temperature $T_C$ of 230 K has been
achieved in (Ba,K)(Zn,Mn)$_2$As$_2$. However, most DMSs, including (Ga,Mn)As,
are p-type, i.e., the carriers that mediate ferromagnetism are holes. For
practical applications, DMS with n-type carriers are also advantageous. Here we
report the successful synthesis of a II-II-V diluted ferromagnetic

where the anomalous exponent $\beta(x) \in (0,1)$ varies in space. This type of
situation occurs e.g. in biophysics, where the density of the intracellular
matrix varies throughout a cell. Scaling limits of CTRWs are known to have
probability distributions which solve fractional Fokker-Planck type equations
(FFPE). This correspondence between stochastic processes and FFPE solutions has
many useful extensions e.g. to nonlinear particle interactions and reactions,
but has not yet been sufficiently developed for FFPEs of the""variable order""
type with non-constant $\beta(x)$.
  In this article, variable order FFPEs (VOFFPE) are derived from scaling
limits of CTRWs. The key mathematical tool is the 1-1 correspondence of a CTRW
scaling limit to a bivariate Langevin process, which tracks the cumulative sum
of jumps in one component and the cumulative sum of waiting times in the other.
The spatially varying anomalous exponent is modelled by spatially varying
$\beta(x)$-stable L\'evy noise in the waiting time component. The VOFFPE
displays a spatially heterogeneous temporal scaling behaviour, with generalized
diffusivity and drift coefficients whose units are length$^2$/time$^{\beta(x)}$
resp. length/time$^{\beta(x)}$. A global change of the time scale results in a
spatially varying change in diffusivity and drift.
  A consequence of the mathematical derivation of a VOFFPE from CTRW limits in
this article is that a solution of a VOFFPE can be approximated via Monte Carlo
simulations. Based on such simulations, we are able to confirm that the VOFFPE
is consistent under a change of the global time scale.

spectrum. In the optical band, the solar radius is 695,700 km and this is what
defines the photosphere, the visible surface of the Sun. However, as the
altitude increases, the electromagnetic radiation is produced at other
frequencies, causing the solar radius to change as function of wavelength.
These measurements enable a better understanding of the solar atmosphere and
the radius dependence on the solar cycle is a good indicator of the changes
that occur in the atmospheric structure. We measure the solar radius at the
subterahertz frequencies of 0.212 and 0.405 THz -- i.e., the altitude where
these emissions are primarily generated -- and also analyse the radius
variation over the 11-year solar activity cycle. For this, we used radio maps
of the solar disk for the period between 1999 and 2017, reconstructed from

days. The strongest emission, observed during the 2011 April ""super-flare,""
exceeded the quiescent level by more than an order of magnitude. These
observations challenge the standard models for particle acceleration in pulsar
wind nebulae, because the radiating electrons have energies exceeding the
classical radiation-reaction limit for synchrotron. Particle-in-cell
simulations have suggested that the classical synchrotron limit can be exceeded
if the electrons also experience electrostatic acceleration due to shock-driven
magnetic reconnection. In this paper, we revisit the problem using an analytic
approach based on solving a fully time-dependent electron transport equation
describing the electrostatic acceleration, synchrotron losses, and escape
experienced by electrons in a magnetically confined plasma ""blob"" as it
encounters and passes through the pulsar-wind termination shock. We show that
our model can reproduce the $\gamma$-ray spectra observed during the rising and
decaying phases of each of the two sub-flare components of the 2011 April
super-flare. We integrate the spectrum for photon energies $\ge 100\,$MeV to
obtain the light curve for the event, which agrees with the observations. We
find that strong electrostatic acceleration occurs on both sides of the
termination shock, driven by magnetic reconnection. We also find that the
dominant mode of particle escape changes from diffusive escape to advective
escape as the blob passes through the shock.

Decomposition Method (MDM) for approximating integrals of $\infty$-variate
functions. Such $\infty$-variate integrals occur for example as expectations in
uncertainty quantification. Starting with the anchored decomposition $f =
\sum_{\mathfrak{u}\subset\mathbb{N}} f_\mathfrak{u}$, where the sum is over all
finite subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ and each $f_\mathfrak{u}$ depends only on the
variables $x_j$ with $j\in\mathfrak{u}$, our MDM algorithm approximates the
integral of $f$ by first truncating the sum to some `active set' and then
approximating the integral of the remaining functions $f_\mathfrak{u}$
term-by-term using Smolyak or (randomized) quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) quadratures.
The anchored decomposition allows us to compute $f_\mathfrak{u}$ explicitly by
function evaluations of $f$. Given the specification of the active set and
theoretically derived parameters of the quadrature rules, we exploit structures
in both the formula for computing $f_\mathfrak{u}$ and the quadrature rules to
develop computationally efficient strategies to implement the MDM in various
scenarios. In particular, we avoid repeated function evaluations at the same
point. We provide numerical results for a test function to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the algorithm.

counter-streaming motions extends to a light bridge, forming a spectacular
circulation pattern around a sunspot, with clockwise motion in the blue wing
and counterclockwise motion in the red wing as observed in Halpha off-bands.
The apparent speed of the flow is around 10 to 60 km/s in the filament,
decreasing to 5 to 20 km/s in the light bridge. The most intriguing results are
the magnetic structure and the counter-streaming motions in the light bridge.
Similar to those in the filament, magnetic fields show a dominant transverse
component in the light bridge. However, the filament is located between
opposite magnetic polarities, while the light bridge is between strong fields
of the same polarity. We analyze the power of oscillations with the image
sequences of constructed Dopplergrams, and find that the filament's
counter-streaming motion is due to physical mass motion along fibrils, while
the light bridge's counter-streaming motion is due to oscillation in the
direction along the line-of-sight. The oscillation power peaks around 4
minutes. However, the section of the light bridge next to the filament also
contains a component of the extension of the filament in combination with the
oscillation, indicating that some strands of the filament are extended to and

Importantly, native iron-sulfur clusters are typically coordinated by cysteinyl

the thiol headgroup adsorption on the sulfur-vacancy site, dissociative

adsorption on the defective surface under vacuum conditions, the formation of
the S-Fe bond is energetically favorable compared with molecular adsorption.
Raman spectroscopic measurements suggest the formation of cystine molecules

realization of twodimensional gapped kagome spin liquid. Theoretically, it has
been proposed that charge doping a quantum spin liquid gives rise to exotic
metallic states, such as high-temperature superconductivity. However, one
recent experiment about herbertsmithite with successful Li-doping shows
surprisingly the insulating state even under the heavy doped scenario, which
can hardly be explained by many-body physics. Using first-principles
calculation, we performed a comprehensive study about the Li intercalated
doping effect of these two compounds. For the Li-doped herbertsmithite, we
identified the optimized Li position at the Cl-(OH)$_3$-Cl pentahedron site
instead of previously speculated Cl-(OH)$_3$ tetrahedral site. With the
increase of Li doping concentration, the saturation magnetization decreases
linearly due to the charge transfer from Li to Cu ions. Moreover, we found that
Li forms chemical bonds with the nearby (OH)$^-$ and Cl$^-$ ions, which lowers
the surrounding chemical potential and traps the electron, as evidenced by the
localized charge distribution, explaining the insulating behavior measured
experimentally. Though with different structure from herbertsmithite, Zn-doped
Barlowite shows the same features upon Li doping. We conclude that Li doping
this family of kagome spin liquid cannot realize exotic metallic states, other
methods should be further explored, such as element substitution with different
valence electrons.

render the demodulation possible, the two signal constellation sets used at the

rotating the constellation set used by the second BS, where the error rate is

thought to be driven not simply by obviously shared characteristics among

the Anderson localization length $\xi$ diverges as $\lambda^m$ in the long

$m=2$, independent of the type of disorder. Here, we show rigorously that
pseudospin-1 systems exhibit non-universal critical behaviors when they are

$m=6$ and the fast divergence is due to a super-Klein-tunneling effect (SKTE).
When we add additional potential fluctuations to the binary disorder, the
critical exponent $m$ crosses over from 6 to 4 as the wavelength increases.
Moreover, for disordered superlattices, in which the random potential layers
are separated by layers of background medium, the exponent $m$ is further
reduced to 2 due to the multiple reflections inside the background layer. To
obtain the above results, we developed a new analytic method based on a stack
recursion equation. Our analytical results are in excellent agreements with the
numerical results obtained by the transfer-matrix method (TMM). For

well known towards Orion~KL, is one of the long-lasting mysteries. We conducted
a survey observation and chemical modeling study to investigate if the
different distributions of O- and N-bearing species are widely recognized in
general star-forming regions. First, we report our observational results of
complex organic molecules (COMs) with the 45~m radio telescope at the Nobeyama
Radio Observatory towards eight star-forming regions. Through our spectral
survey ranging from 80 to 108~GHz, we detected CH$_3$OH, HCOOCH$_3$,
CH$_3$OCH$_3$, (CH$_3$)$_2$CO, CH$_3$CHO, CH$_3$CH$_2$CN, CH$_2$CHCN, and
NH$_2$CHO. Their molecular abundances were derived via the rotation diagram and
the least squares methods. We found that N-bearing molecules, tend to show
stronger correlations with other N-bearing molecules rather than O-bearing
molecules. While G10.47+0.03 showed high fractional abundances of N-bearing
species, those in NGC6334F were not so rich, being less than 0.01 compared to
CH$_3$OH. Then, the molecular abundances towards these sources were evaluated
by chemical modeling with NAUTILUS three-phase gas-grain chemical code. Through
the simulations of time evolutions for the abundances of COMs, we suggest that
observed correlations of fractional abundances between COMs can be explained by
the combination of the different temperature structures inside the hot cores
and the different evolutionary phase. Since our modeling could not fully
explain the observed excitation temperatures, it is important to investigate
the efficiency of grain surface reactions and their activation barriers, and
the binding energy of COMs to further promote our understanding.

certain range of the impact velocity. Although the growth of the jet as well as
its tip velocity is predicted from similar cases to the droplet impact, the
mechanism of the jet generation is yet to be understood. In this study,
high-speed visualization of the droplet impact on a superhydrophobic surface
was conducted to understand the initiation of the jet generated by a collapse
of an air cavity. Water droplets whose diameter are 2.0 mm and 3.0 mm were
generated and the Weber number of the droplet was varied in a range of 2 to 20.
The jet velocity was measured from the captured images and it was found that it
has a peak at the Weber number equals to approximately seven. The resulting jet
velocity at the peak was approximately 15 folds higher than the impact
velocity. Moreover, we observed that surface waves were generated by a
collision of the droplet on the solid and the waves induced an oscillation of
the droplet cap as they propagate from the solid-liquid contact line to the top
portion of the droplet. Furthermore, we found the phase of the oscillation is
related to the Weber number and it influences the jet velocity significantly,
as it determines the initial condition of the jet generation.

electric vehicle charging behavior from the aspects of time window, charging
demand and availability of unoccupied charges, and further incorporates a
centralized and intelligent fleet dispatching platform, which is capable of
handling taxi service requests and arranging electric taxis' recharging in real
time. To address the impacts of the limited driving range and long
battery-recharging time on the electrified fleet's operations efficiency, the
dispatching platform integrates the information of customers, taxi drivers and
charging stations, and adopts a rule-based approach to achieve multiple
objectives, including reducing taxi customers' average waiting time, increasing
the taxi demand fill rate and guaranteeing the equity of the income among taxi
drivers. Although this study only examines one type of fleet in a specific

inverse Monte-Carlo method. The coupling constants $F(i)$ of the effective
action depend on the coupling of the lattice action $\beta$ and the number of

almost perfect action corresponding to the continuum limit, since $a\to 0$ as
$n\to\infty$ for fixed $b$. The almost perfect action showing the scaling is
found to be independent of the smooth gauges adopted here. Then we compare the
results with those obtained by the analytic blocking method of topological
defects from the continuum. The infrared monopole action can be transformed
into that of the string model. The physical string tension and the lowest

expression. In light of these models, we examine data from a beautiful recent
experiment that created a single-chain version of the CRP homodimer, thereby
enabling each subunit to be mutated separately. Using this construct, six

a D53H mutant subunit, and an S62F mutant subunit. We demonstrate that both the

more importantly the parameters inferred by the MWC model are more in line with

an open issue in physics. The appearance of muons, kaons, hyperons, and other
exotic particles in the inner regions of the NS, favored by energetic
considerations, is considered to be an effective mechanism to soften the
equation of state (EoS). In the so-called two-families scenario, the softening
of the EoS allows for NSs characterized by very small radii, which become
unstable and convert into a quark stars (QSs). In the process of conversion of
a NS into a QS material can be ablated by neutrinos from the surface of the
star. Not only neutron-rich nuclei, but also more exotic material, such as
hypernuclei or deconfined quarks, could be ejected into the atmosphere. In the
NS atmosphere, atoms like H, He, and C should exist, and attempts to model the
NS thermal emission taking into account their presence, with spectra modified
by the extreme magnetic fields, have been done. However, exotic atoms, like
muonic hydrogen $(p\,\mu^-)$ or the so-called Sigmium $(\Sigma^+\,e^-)$, could
also be present during the conversion process or in its immediate aftermath. At
present, analytical expressions of the wave functions and eigenvalues for these
atoms have been calculated only for H. In this work, we extend the existing
solutions and parametrizations to the exotic atoms $(p\,\mu^-)$ and
$(\Sigma^+\,e^-)$, making some predictions on possible transitions. Their
detection in the spectra of NS would provide experimental evidence for the
existence of hyperons in the interior of these stars.

  In this paper we consider the edge-Wiener index and the edge-hyper-Wiener

For an arbitrary phenylene, four quotient trees based on the elementary cuts
are defined in a similar way as it was previously done for benzenoid systems.
The computation of the edge-Wiener index of the phenylene is then reduced to
the calculation of the weighted Wiener indices of the corresponding quotient

new network architecture called Hierarchical Cross Network (HCN) to perform
person re-ID. In addition to the backbone model of a conventional CNN, HCN is
equipped with two additional maps called hierarchical cross feature maps. The
maps of an HCN are formed by merging layers with different resolutions and
semantic levels. With the hierarchical cross feature maps, an HCN can
effectively uncover additional semantic features which could not be discovered
by a conventional CNN. Although the proposed HCN can discover features with
higher semantics, its representation power is still limited. To derive more
general representations, we augment the data during the training process by
combining multiple datasets. Experiment results show that the proposed method
outperformed several state-of-the-art methods.

describes the spectra of lamps. This parameter gives the temperature (measured
in kelvins) of the black body that would show the hue more similar to that of
the light emitted by the lamp. Modern lamps for indoor and outdoor lighting
display many spectral energy distributions, most of them extremely different to
those of black bodies, what makes CCT to be far from a perfect descriptor from
the physical point of view. The spectral index system presented in this work
provides an accurate, objective, quantitative procedure to characterize the
spectral properties of lamps, with just a few numbers. The system is an
adaptation to lighting technology of the classical procedures of multi-band
astronomical photometry with wide and intermediate-band filters. We describe
the basic concepts and we apply the system to a representative set of lamps of
many kinds. The results lead to interesting, sometimes surprising conclusions.
The spectral index system is extremely easy to implement from the spectral data
that are routinely measured at laboratories. Thus, including this kind of
computations in the standard protocols for the certification of lamps will be
really straightforward, and will enrich the technical description of lighting
devices.

specular highlights more prominently than smaller distant streaks. These
different effects of different streaks have their own characteristics in their

since it attains an optimal rate of convergence for various function spaces.
Its integration nodes are given by shrinking a suitable full rank
$\mathbb{Z}$-lattice in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and taking all points inside the unit
cube. The main drawback of these nodes is that they are hard to find
computationally, especially in high dimensions.In such situations, quasi-Monte
Carlo (QMC) rules based on digital nets have proven to be successful. However,
there is still no construction known that leads to QMC rules which are optimal
in the same generality as Frolov's.
  In this paper we investigate a polynomial analog of Frolov's cubature
formula, which we expect to be important in this respect. This analog is
defined in a field of Laurent series with coefficients in a finite field. A
similar approach was previously studied in [M.~B.~Levin. Adelic constructions
of low discrepancy sequences. Online Journal of Analytic Combinatorics. Issue
5, 2010.].
  We show that our construction is a $(t,m,d)$-net, which also implies bounds
on its star-discrepancy and the error of the corresponding cubature rule.
Moreover, we show that our cubature rule is a QMC rule, whereas Frolov's is
not, and provide an algorithm to determine its integration nodes explicitly.
  To this end we need to extend the notion of $(t,m,d)$-nets to fit the
situation that the points can have infinite digit expansion and develop a
duality theory. Additionally, we adapt the notion of admissible lattices to our
setting and prove its significance.

bounded polytopes named the Actuation Wrench Polytope (AWP) and the Feasible
Wrench Polytope (FWP). We define the AWP as the set of all the wrenches that a
robot can generate while considering its actuation limits. This considers the
admissible contact forces that the robot can generate given its current
configuration and actuation capabilities. The Contact Wrench Cone (CWC),
instead, includes features of the environment such as the contact normal or the
friction coefficient. The intersection of the AWP and of the CWC results in a
convex polytope, the FWP, which turns out to be more descriptive of the real
robot capabilities than existing simplified models, while maintaining the same
compact representation. We explain how to efficiently compute the
vertex-description of the FWP that is then used to evaluate a feasibility
factor that we adapted from the field of robotic grasping. This allows us to
optimize for robustness to external disturbance wrenches. Based on this, we
present an implementation of a motion planner for our quadruped robot HyQ that

scattering by small particles. Beyond being purely set by scatterer size and
material, in fact polarizability can be affected by backaction: the influence
of the photonic environment on the scatterer. As such, controlling the strength
of backaction provides a tool to tailor the (radiative) properties of
nanoparticles. Here, we control the backaction between broadband scatterers and
a single mode of a high-quality cavity. We demonstrate that backaction from a
microtoroid ring resonator significantly alters the polarizability of an array
of nanorods: the polarizability is renormalized as fields scattered from -- and
returning to -- the nanorods via the ring resonator depolarize the rods.
Moreover, we show that it is possible to control the strength of the backaction
by exploiting the diffractive properties of the array. This perturbation of a
strong scatterer by a nearby cavity has important implications for hybrid
plasmonic-photonic resonators and the understanding of coupled optical
resonators in general.

fan-crossing if it admits a drawing in the plane so that each edge is crossed
by edges of a fan. It is fan-planar if, in addition, the common endpoint is on
the same side of the crossed edge. A graph is adjacency-crossing if it admits a
drawing so that crossing edges are adjacent. Then it excludes independent
crossings which are crossings by edges with no common endpoint.
Adjacency-crossing allows triangle-crossings in which an edge crosses the edges
of a triangle, which is excluded at fan-crossing graphs.
  We show that every adjacency-crossing graph is fan-crossing. Thus
triangle-crossings can be avoided. On the other hand, there are fan-crossing
graphs that are not fan-planar, whereas for every fan-crossing graph there is a
fan-planar graph on the same set of vertices and with the same number of edges.
Hence, fan-crossing and fan-planar graphs are different, but they do not differ
in their density with at most 5n - 10 edges for graphs of size n.

a family of non-primitive BCH codes of length $n=q^{m}+1$ (also called
antiprimitive) is studied. These codes are also linear codes with complementary
duals (called LCD codes). Through some approaches such as iterative algorithm,
partition and scaling, all coset leaders of $C_{x}$ modulo $n$ with $q^{\lceil

determined. Furthermore, a new kind of sequences is introduced to determine the
second largest coset leader modulo $n$ with $m$ even and $q$ odd. Also, for
even $m$ some conjectures about the first several coset leaders modulo $n$ are
proposed, whose complete verification would wipe out the difficult problem to
determine the first several coset leaders of antiprimitive BCH codes. After
deriving the cardinalities of the coset leaders, we shall calculate exact

architecture for semantic alignment that is trainable in an end-to-end manner
from weak image-level supervision in the form of matching image pairs. The
outcome is that parameters are learnt from rich appearance variation present in
different but semantically related images without the need for tedious manual
annotation of correspondences at training time. Second, the main component of
this architecture is a differentiable soft inlier scoring module, inspired by
the RANSAC inlier scoring procedure, that computes the quality of the alignment

specifically, in their model, there is a query oracle that answers queries of

Ashtiani et al. showed the usefulness of such a query framework by giving a
polynomial time algorithm for the k-means clustering problem where the input
dataset satisfies some separation condition. Ailon et al. extended the above
work to the approximation setting by giving an efficient (1+\eps)-approximation
algorithm for k-means for any small \eps > 0 and any dataset within the SSAC
framework. In this work, we extend this line of study to the correlation
clustering problem. Correlation clustering is a graph clustering problem where
pairwise similarity (or dissimilarity) information is given for every pair of
vertices and the objective is to partition the vertices into clusters that
minimise the disagreement (or maximises agreement) with the pairwise
information given as input. These problems are popularly known as MinDisAgree
and MaxAgree problems, and MinDisAgree[k] and MaxAgree[k] are versions of these
problems where the number of optimal clusters is at most k. There exist
Polynomial Time Approximation Schemes (PTAS) for MinDisAgree[k] and MaxAgree[k]

running time is polynomial in the input parameters but exponential in k and

game-theoretic model - the N-player evolutionary trust game - consisting of
three types of players: investors, trustworthy trustees, and untrustworthy
trustees. Interactions between players are limited to local neighborhoods
determined by predefined spatial or social network topologies. We compare
evolutionary update rules based on the payoffs obtained by their neighbors.
Specifically, we investigate the dynamics generated when players use a
deterministic strategic rule (i.e., unconditional imitation with and without
using a noise process induced by a voter model), a stochastic pairwise
payoff-based strategy (i.e., proportional imitation), and stochastic local
Moran processes. We explore the system dynamics under these update rules based
on different social networks and different levels of game difficulty. We
observe that there are significant differences on the promoted trust and global
net wealth depending on the update rule. If the game is harder, rules based on
unconditional imitation achieve the highest global net wealth in the
population. Besides a global perspective, we also study the spatial and
temporal dynamics induced by the rules and we find important spatio-temporal
correlations in the system for all rules. Indeed, the update rules lead to the
formation of fractal structures on a lattice and, when the rules are
stochastic, also the emergence of low frequencies in the output signal of the

light curves of the BL Lac object PG 1553+113 at several electromagnetic bands
represents the first case of such odd behavior reported in the literature.
Motivated by this, we analyzed 15 GHz interferometric maps of the parsec-scale
radio jet of PG 1553+113 to verify the presence of a possible counterpart of
this periodic variability. We used the Cross-Entropy statistical technique to
obtain the structural parameters of the Gaussian components present in the
radio maps of this source. We kinematically identified seven jet components
formed coincidentally with flare-like features seen in the $\gamma$-ray light
curve. From the derived jet component positions in the sky plane and their
kinematics (ejection epochs, proper motions, and sky position angles), we
modeled their temporal changes in terms of a relativistic jet that is steadily
precessing in time. Our results indicate a precession period in the observer's
reference frame of $2.24\pm0.03$ years, compatible with the periodicity
detected in the light curves of PG 1553+113. However, the maxima of the jet
Doppler boosting factor are systematically delayed relative to the peaks of the
main $\gamma$-ray flares. We propose two scenarios that could explain this
delay, both based on the existence of a supermassive black hole binary system
in PG 1553+113. We estimated the characteristics of this putative binary system
that also would be responsible for driving the inferred jet precession.

extensively evaluate the performance of various UL SRS allocation strategies in
practical deployments, shedding light on their strengths and weaknesses.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel UL SRS fractional reuse (FR) scheme, denoted
neighbour-aware FR (FR-NA). The proposed FR-NA generalizes the fixed reuse
paradigm, and entails a tradeoff between i) aggressively sharing some UL SRS
resources, and ii) protecting other UL SRS resources with the aim of relieving
neighbouring BSs from pilot contamination. Said features result in a cell
throughput improvement over both fixed reuse and state-of-the-art FR based on a

methods for computing matrix functions, such as the matrix exponential and the
Mittag-Leffler function. These methods provide successful ways to solve partial
differential equations, such as convection--diffusion models. Part of the
success of these methods comes from exploiting the freedom to choose the
contour, by appealing to Cauchy's theorem. However, the pseudospectra of
non-normal matrices or operators present a challenge for these methods: if the
contour is too close to regions where the norm of the resolvent matrix is
large, then the accuracy suffers. Important applications that involve
non-normal matrices or operators include the Black--Scholes equation of
finance, and Fokker--Planck equations for stochastic models arising in biology.
Consequently, it is crucial to choose the contour carefully. As a remedy, we
discuss choosing a contour that is wider than it might otherwise have been for
a normal matrix or operator. We also suggest a semi-analytic approach to
adapting the contour, in the form of a parabolic bound that is derived by
estimating the field of values. To demonstrate the utility of the approaches
that we advocate, we study three models in biology: a monomolecular reaction, a
bimolecular reaction and a trimolecular reaction. Modelling and simulation of
these reactions is done within the framework of Markov processes. We also

string models that are stable, with near-vanishing one-loop dilaton tadpoles
and cosmological constants. This opens up the tantalizing possibility of
realizing stable string models whose low-energy limits directly resemble the
Standard Model rather than one of its supersymmetric extensions. In this paper
we consider the general structure of such strings and find that they share two
important phenomenological properties. The first is a so-called ""GUT-precursor""
structure in which new GUT-like states appear with masses that can be many
orders of magnitude lighter than the scale of gauge coupling unification. These
states allow a parametrically large compactification volume, even in weakly
coupled heterotic strings, and in certain regions of parameter space can give
rise to dramatic collider signatures which serve as ""smoking guns"" for this
overall string framework. The second is a residual ""entwined-SUSY"" (or e-SUSY)
structure for the matter multiplets in which different multiplet components
carry different horizontal $U(1)$ charges. As a concrete example and existence
proof of these features, we present a heterotic string model that contains the
fundamental building blocks of the Standard Model such as the Standard-Model
gauge group, complete chiral generations, and Higgs fields --- all without
supersymmetry. Even though massless gravitinos and gauginos are absent from the
spectrum, we confirm that this model has an exponentially suppressed one-loop
dilaton tadpole and displays both the GUT-precursor and e-SUSY structures. We
also discuss some general phenomenological properties of e-SUSY, such as
cancellations in radiative corrections to scalar masses, the possible existence
of a corresponding approximate moduli space, and the prevention of rapid proton
decay.

are bent in the direction of a foreground lensing mass distribution. Diverging
lens behaviour produces deflections in the opposite sense to gravitational
lensing, and is also of astrophysical interest. In fact, diverging lensing due
to compact distributions of plasma has been proposed as an explanation for the
extreme scattering events (ESEs) that produce frequency-dependent dimming of
extra-galactic radio sources, and may also be related to the refractive
radio-wave phenomena observed to affect the flux density of pulsars. In this
work we study the behaviour of two families of astrophysical diverging lenses
in the geometric optics limit, the power-law and the exponential plasma lenses.
Generally, the members of these model families show distinct behaviour in terms
of image formation and magnification, however the inclusion of a finite core
for certain power-law lenses can produce a caustic and critical curve
morphology that is similar to the well-studied Gaussian plasma lens. Both model
families can produce dual radial critical curves, a novel distinction from the
tangential distortion usually produced by gravitational (converging) lenses.
The deflection angle and magnification of a plasma lens varies with the
observational frequency, producing wavelength-dependent magnifications that
alter the amplitudes and the shape of the light curves. Thus, multi-wavelength
observations can be used to physically constrain the distribution of the
electron density in such lenses.

2012 and May 2016 for analysis at 6-hr cadence. Results from this statistical
study include: i) the $B_{r}$ component results in a slight upwards shift of
property values in a manner consistent with a field-strength underestimation by
the $B_{\rm los}$ component; ii) using the $B_{r}$ component results in
significantly lower inter-property correlation in one-third of the cases,
implying more independent information about the state of the AR photospheric

values of properties, except Fourier spectral power index that has flare rates
peaking around a value of $5/3$. These findings indicate that there may be
advantages in using $B_{r}$ rather than $B_{\rm los}$ in calculating
flare-related AR magnetic properties, especially for regions located far from

spectrum sensing (CSS) is used in CR to improve detection capability. Due to
its simplicity and low complexity, sensing based on energy detection known as
conventional energy detection (CED) is widely adopted. CED can be generalized
by changing the squaring operation of the amplitude of received samples by an
arbitrary positive power p which is referred to as the generalized energy
detector (GED). The performance of GED degrades when there exists noise
uncertainty (NU). In this paper, we investigate the performance of CSS by
considering the noise NU when all the secondary users (SUs) employ GED. We
derive the signal to noise ratio (SNR) wall for CSS for both hard and soft
decision combining. All the derived expressions are validated using Monte Carlo

difficult as sufficient training data is not available and it is often

cross language platform for handwritten word recognition and spotting for such
low-resource scripts where training is performed with a sufficiently large
dataset of an available script (considered as source script) and testing is
done on other scripts (considered as target script). Training with one source
script and testing with another script to have a reasonable result is not easy
in handwriting domain due to the complex nature of handwriting variability
among scripts. Also it is difficult in mapping between source and target
characters when they appear in cursive word images. The proposed Indic cross
language framework exploits a large resource of dataset for training and uses
it for recognizing and spotting text of other target scripts where sufficient
amount of training data is not available. Since, Indic scripts are mostly
written in 3 zones, namely, upper, middle and lower, we employ zone-wise
character (or component) mapping for efficient learning purpose. The
performance of our cross-language framework depends on the extent of similarity
between the source and target scripts. Hence, we devise an entropy based script
similarity score using source to target character mapping that will provide a
feasibility of cross language transcription. We have tested our approach in
three Indic scripts, namely, Bangla, Devanagari and Gurumukhi, and the
corresponding results are reported.

some of the protostars remain sufficiently low mass and long-lived to survive

forming region while their mass is less than $0.8 M_{\odot}$. Assuming that the
protostars gain mass via the spherical Bondi--Hoyle accretion from the ambient

certain range of mass and are ejected with velocity larger than the escape
velocity may survive to the present day on the main sequence. Thus, they may
even be found in our Milky Way or its satellites. Our calculations also reveal
that protostars that do not get ejected from the parent gas clump accrete a
large amount of gas. We predict that these can become massive enough to be
progenitors of black holes.

reached a flux $f \sim 10^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, which allowed us to
perform a detailed analysis of its timing and spectral properties. We obtained
a pulse period $P_{\rm spin}$ = 11.58208(2) s. The pulse profile is double
peaked and strongly energy dependent, as the second peak is prominent only at
low energies and the pulsed fraction increases with energy. The main spectral
component is a power-law model, but at low energies we also detected a soft
thermal component, which can be described with either a blackbody or a hot
plasma model. Both the EPIC and RGS spectra show several emission lines, which
can be identified with the transition lines of ionized N, O, Ne, and Fe and
cannot be described with a thermal emission model. The phase-resolved spectral
analysis showed that the flux of both the soft excess and the emission lines
vary with the pulse phase: the soft excess disappears in the first pulse and
becomes significant only in the second, where also the Fe line is stronger.
This variability is difficult to explain with emission from a hot plasma, while
the reprocessing of the primary X-ray emission at the inner edge of the
accretion disk provides a realiable scenario. On the other hand, the narrow
emission lines can be due to the presence of photoionized matter around the
accreting source.

linearly with the increasing Ga content. At the same time, the reduction of the

the bottom of the conduction band and arising from the Ga3+ ion perturbed by
the nearest neighboring Ce3+ ion. The electrons thermally released from the

hinges on the appearance of massless poles in the fundamental vertices of the

The process responsible for the formation of such structures is itself
dynamical in nature, and is governed by a set of Bethe-Salpeter type of
integral equations. While in previous studies the presence of massless poles
was assumed to be exclusively associated with the background-gauge three-gluon
vertex, in the present analysis we allow them to appear also in the
corresponding ghost-gluon vertex. The full analysis of the resulting
Bethe-Salpeter system reveals that the contribution of the poles associated
with the ghost-gluon vertex are particularly suppressed, their sole discernible
effect being a slight modification in the running of the gluon mass, for
momenta larger than a few GeV. In addition, we examine the behavior of the
(background-gauge) ghost-gluon vertex in the limit of vanishing ghost momentum,
and derive the corresponding version of Taylor's theorem. These considerations,
together with a suitable Ansatz, permit us the full reconstruction of the pole
sector of the two vertices involved.

to about 100 K in both YAG and LuAG crystals. At higher temperatures, thermally
liberated holes are retrapped at oxygen ions in the vicinity of an acceptor ion
such as Mg2+ and Al_{Y} or Al_{Lu} antisite ion that leads to increase of the
thermal stability of the trapped hole to app. 150 K. TSL measurements show two

quasiparticles stands out as one of the highlights in quantum physics. It
provides an accurate description of otherwise prohibitively complex many-body
systems, and has led to the development of several key technologies. In this
paper, we investigate theoretically the Landau effective interaction between
quasiparticles, so-called Bose polarons, formed by impurity particles immersed
in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). In the limit of weak interactions between
the impurities and the BEC, we derive rigorous results for the effective
interaction. They show that it can be strong even for weak impurity-boson
interaction, if the transferred momentum/energy between the quasiparticles is
resonant with a sound mode in the BEC. We then develop a diagrammatic scheme to
calculate the effective interaction for arbitrary coupling strengths, which
recovers the correct weak coupling results. Using this, we show that the Landau
effective interaction in general is significantly stronger than that between
quasiparticles in a Fermi gas, mainly because a BEC is more compressible than a
Fermi gas. The interaction is particularly large near the unitarity limit of
the impurity-boson scattering, or when the quasiparticle momentum is close to
the threshold for momentum relaxation in the BEC. Finally, we show how the
Landau effective interaction leads to a sizeable shift of the quasiparticle
energy with increasing impurity concentration, which should be detectable with
present day experimental techniques.

the latent representation. We apply this generic data-augmentation method to
obtain Bayes factors for three popular rank-based tests: the rank sum test, the

are continuing to expand the transfer reaction toolbox in preparation for the
next generation of facilities, such as the Facility for Rare Ion Beams (FRIB),

to perform the (d,n) reaction in inverse kinematics, with analyses that include
Q-value spectra and differential cross sections. In this way, proton-transfer
reactions can be placed on the same level as the more commonly used
neutron-transfer reactions, such as (d,p), (9Be,8Be), and (13C,12C). Here we
present an overview of the techniques used in (d,p) and (d,n), and some recent

stochastic switching process for the coupled dynamics of replica configuration

analysis of the convergence properties of parallel tempering by large deviation
theory, which indicates that the method should be operated in the infinite
swapping limit to maximize sampling efficiency. The effective equation for the
replica alone that arises in this infinite swapping limit simply involves
replacing the original potential by a mixture potential. The analysis of the
geometric properties of this potential offers a new perspective on the issues
of how to choose of temperature ladder, and why many temperatures should
typically be introduced to boost the sampling efficiency. It is also shown how
to simulate the effective equation in this many temperature regime using
multiscale integrators. Finally, similar ideas are also used to discuss

solar atmosphere. One of the effects of twist is to modify the properties of
the eigenmodes of magnetic tubes. In the linear regime standing kink solutions
are characterized by a change in polarization of the transverse displacement
along the twisted tube. In the nonlinear regime, magnetic twist affects the
development of shear instabilities that appear at the tube boundary when it is
oscillating laterally. These Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (KHI) are produced
either by the jump in the azimuthal component of the velocity at the edge of
the sharp boundary between the internal and external part of the tube, or
either by the continuous small length-scales produced by phase-mixing when
there is a smooth inhomogeneous layer. In this work the effect of twist is
consistently investigated by solving the time-dependent problem including the
process of energy transfer to the inhomogeneous layer. It is found that twist
always delays the appearance of the shear instability but for tubes with thin
inhomogeneous layers the effect is relatively small for moderate values of
twist. On the contrary, for tubes with thick layers, the effect of twist is
much stronger. This can have some important implications regarding observations
of transverse kink modes and the KHI itself.

Additionally, a time-series of 996 high-cadence spectra in one cross disperser

based on Th-Ar exposures and simultaneous Fabry-Perot combs enables an absolute
wavelength solution within 10 m/s (rms) with respect to the HARPS laser-comb

obtained, including the diffusion path, attempt frequency, activation energies,
and collective diffusion processes. These detailed diffusion properties provide
a thorough understanding of diffusion in solid electrolytes, and provides
direction for the design of improved solid electrolyte materials. Here a
thorough analysis methodology is developed, and applied to DFT MD simulations
of Li-ion diffusion in \beta-Li3PS4. The methodology presented is generally
applicable to crystalline materials and facilitates the analysis of molecular
dynamics simulations. The code used for the analysis is freely available at:
https://bitbucket.org/niekdeklerk/md-analysis-with-matlab. The results on
\beta-Li3PS4 demonstrate that jumps between bc-planes limit the conductivity of
this important class of solid electrolyte materials. The simulations indicate
that by adding Li-interstitials or Li-vacancies the rate limiting jump process
can be accelerated significantly, which induces three dimensional diffusion,
resulting in an increased Li-ion diffusivity. Li-vacancies can be introduced
through Br-doping, which is predicted to result in an order of magnitude larger
Li-ion conductivity in \beta-Li3PS4. Furthermore, the present simulations

the accurate determination of the effective number of neutrinos $N_{\rm eff}$.
Reaching an experimental sensitivity of $\Delta N_{\rm eff} = 0.013$ could
indeed falsify the presence of any non-standard relativistic particles at $95
\%$ c.l.. In this paper, we test how this future constraint can be affected by
the removal of two common assumptions: a negligible running of the inflationary
spectral index $n_{\rm run}$ and a precise determination of the neutron
lifetime $\tau_n$. We first show that the constraints on $N_{\rm eff}$ could be
significantly biased by the unaccounted presence of a running of the spectral
index. Considering the Stage-IV experiment, a negative running of ${\rm
d}n/{\rm d}\ln k= - 0.002$ could mimic a positive variation of $\Delta N_{\rm
eff} = 0.03$. Moreover, given the current discrepancies between experimental
measurements of the neutron lifetime $\tau_n$, we show that the assumption of a
conservative error of $\Delta\tau_n \sim 10$s could bring to a systematic error
of $\Delta N_{\rm eff} = 0.02$. Complementary cosmological constraints on the
running of the spectral index and a solution to the neutron lifetime
discrepancy are therefore needed for an accurate and reliable future CMB bound
of $N_{\rm eff}$ at percent level.

(ii) a breathing Onsager sphere. Due to the time-dependent solvent, the
frequency-dependent response function of the dipole becomes time-dependent. For

is reflected in a temporally increasing line width of the absorptive part of
the response. Furthermore, the effective frequency-dependent response function
shows two peaks in the absorptive part which are symmetrically shifted around
the eigenfrequency. In contrast, a breathing sphere reduces damping as compared
to the static sphere. Interestingly, we find a non-monotonous dependence of the
relaxation rate on the breathing rate and a resonant suppression of damping
when both rates are comparable. Moreover, the line width of the absorptive part

interacting entities represented by network data. Role discovery is the task of
uncovering hidden roles. Node roles are commonly defined in terms of
equivalence classes, where two nodes have the same role if they fall within the
same equivalence class. Automorphic equivalence, where two nodes are equivalent
when they can swap their labels to form an isomorphic graph, captures this
common notion of role. The binary concept of equivalence is too restrictive and
nodes in real-world networks rarely belong to the same equivalence class.
Instead, a relaxed definition in terms of similarity or distance is commonly
used to compute the degree to which two nodes are equivalent. In this paper, we
propose a novel distance metric called automorphic distance, which measures how
far two nodes are of being automorphically equivalent. We also study its
application to node embedding, showing how our metric can be used to generate
vector representations of nodes preserving their roles for data visualization
and machine learning. Our experiments confirm that the proposed metric
outperforms the RoleSim automorphic equivalence-based metric in the generation
of node embeddings for different networks.

$r_\Lambda$ corresponding to a maximum size of a circular orbit of a test mass
in a gravitationally bound system, which is the geometric mean of the
cosmological horizon size squared, and the Schwarzschild radius. This agrees
well with the size of a galactic halo when the effects of dark matter are
included. The size of larger structures such as galactic clusters and
superclusters are also well-approximated by this scale. This model provides a
simplified approach to computing the size of such structures without the usual
detailed dynamical models. Some of the more detailed approaches that appear in
the literature are reviewed, and we find the length scales agree to within a
factor of order one. Finally, we note the length scale associated with the
effects of MOND or Verlinde's emergent gravity, which offer explanations of the
flattening of galaxy rotation curves without invoking dark matter, may be
expressed as the geometric mean of the cosmological horizon size and the
Schwarzschild radius, which is typically 100 times smaller than $r_\Lambda$.

either to build new facilities and experiments, or to upgrade existing ones.
Similarly, it requires commensurate investment in the R&D of software to
acquire, manage, process, and analyse the shear amounts of data to be recorded.
In planning for the HL-LHC in particular, it is critical that all of the
collaborating stakeholders agree on the software goals and priorities, and that
the efforts complement each other. In this spirit, this white paper describes
the R&D activities required to prepare for this software upgrade.

to infer and quantify main and interaction effects in metric multivariate
multi-factor data. It is, however, neither robust against change in units nor a
meaningful tool for ordinal data. Thus, we propose a novel nonparametric
MANOVA. Contrary to existing rank-based procedures we infer hypotheses
formulated in terms of meaningful Mann-Whitney-type effects in lieu of
distribution functions. The tests are based on a quadratic form in multivariate
rank effect estimators and critical values are obtained by the bootstrap. This
newly developed procedure consequently provides asymptotically exact and
consistent inference for general models such as the nonparametric
Behrens-Fisher problem as well as multivariate one-, two-, and higher-way
crossed layouts. Computer simulations in small samples confirm the reliability
of the developed method for ordinal as well as metric data with covariance
heterogeneity. Finally, an analysis of a real data example illustrates the
applicability and correct interpretation of the results.

target for (sub)millimeter observations due to, both, the rich chemistry toward
the two main components of the binary and its complex morphology. Its proximity
to Earth allows the study of its physical and chemical structure on solar
system scales using high angular resolution observations. Such data reveal a
complex morphology that cannot be accounted for in traditional, spherical 1D
models of the envelope. Aims. The purpose of this paper is to study the
environment of the two components of the binary through 3D radiative transfer
modeling and to compare with data from the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array. Such comparisons can be used to constrain the
protoplanetary disk structures, the luminosities of the two components of the
binary and the chemistry of simple species. Methods. We present 13CO, C17O and
C18O J=3-2 observations from the ALMA Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey
(PILS), together with a qualitative study of the dust and gas density
distribution of IRAS 16293-2422. A 3D dust and gas model including disks and a
dust filament between the two protostars is constructed which qualitatively
reproduces the dust continuum and gas line emission. Results and conclusions.
Radiative transfer modeling of source A and B, with the density solution of an
infalling, rotating collapse or a protoplanetary disk model, can match the
constraints for the disk-like emission around source A and B from the observed
dust continuum and CO isotopologue gas emission. If a protoplanetary disk model
is used around source B, it has to have an unusually high scale-height in order
to reach the dust continuum peak emission value, while fulfilling the other
observational constraints. Our 3D model requires source A to be much more
luminous than source B; LA ~ 18 $L_\odot$ and LB ~ 3 $L_\odot$.

complete reconstruction of supernova neutrino spectra in the future large
liquid-scintillator detectors, by implementing the method of singular value
decomposition with a proper regularization. For a core-collapse supernova at a
distance of $10~{\rm kpc}$ in the Milky Way, its $\overline{\nu}^{}_e$ spectrum
can be precisely determined from the inverse beta-decay process
$\overline{\nu}^{}_e + p \to e^+ + n$, for which a $20~{\rm kiloton}$
liquid-scintillator detector with the resolution similar to the Jiangmen
Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) may register more than 5000 events. We
have to rely predominantly on the elastic neutrino-electron scattering $\nu +
e^- \to \nu + e^-$ and the elastic neutrino-proton scattering $\nu + p \to \nu
+ p$ for the spectra of $\nu^{}_e$ and $\nu^{}_x$, where $\nu$ denotes
collectively neutrinos and antineutrinos of all three flavors and $\nu^{}_x$
for $\nu^{}_\mu$ and $\nu^{}_\tau$ as well as their antiparticles. To
demonstrate the validity of our approach, we also attempt to reconstruct the
neutrino spectra by using the time-integrated neutrino data from the latest
numerical simulations of delayed neutrino-driven supernova explosions.

continuous wavelength coverage from 4230 to 9120A, and S/N between 150 and
550:1 (blue to red). We performed a detailed chemical analysis to determine the
photospheric abundances of 18 chemical elements, in order to use the abundances
to place constraints on the bulk composition of the five rocky planets. Our
spectral analysis employs the equivalent width method for most of our spectral
lines, but we used spectral synthesis to fit a small number of lines that
require special care. In both cases, we derived our abundances using the MOOG
spectral analysis package and Kurucz model atmospheres. We find no correlation
between elemental abundance and condensation temperature among the refractory
elements. In addition, using our spectroscopic stellar parameters and isochrone
fitting, we find an age of 10+/-1.5 Gyr, which is consistent with the
asteroseismic age of 11+/-1 Gyr. Finally, from the photospheric abundances of
Mg, Si, and Fe, we estimate that the typical Fe-core mass fraction for the
rocky planets in the Kepler-444 system is approximately 24 per cent. If our
estimate of the Fe-core mass fraction is confirmed by more detailed modeling of
the disk chemistry and simulations of planet formation and evolution in the
Kepler-444 system, then this would suggest that rocky planets in more
metal-poor and alpha-enhanced systems may tend to be less dense than their
counterparts of comparable size in more metal-rich systems.

Science Laboratory rover Curiosity on the surface of Mars has been measuring
this effect for over four Earth years (about two Martian years). The

rates and pressure changes has been investigated by Rafkin et al. (2014) and
the long-term solar modulation has also been empirically analyzed and modeled
by Guo et al. (2015). This paper employs the newly updated HZETRN2015 code to
model the Martian atmospheric shielding effect on the accumulated dose rates
and the change of this effect under different solar modulation and atmospheric
conditions. The modeled results are compared with the most up-to-date (from 14
August 2012 to 29 June 2016) observations of the RAD instrument on the surface
of Mars. Both model and measurements agree reasonably well and show the
atmospheric shielding effect under weak solar modulation conditions and the
decline of this effect as solar modulation becomes stronger. This result is
important for better risk estimations of future human explorations to Mars
under different heliospheric and Martian atmospheric conditions.

Stark-chirp rapid-adiabatic passage (SCRAP) in two-level systems with electric
fields computed with the optimal control theory. The Pontryagin maximum
principle is used to determine the robust optimal control fields in the
presence of time-varying and spatially-inhomogeneous perturbing electric
fields. The concept of a non-adiabatic correction to the Bloch vector dynamics
is introduced and discussed. The existence of a non-zero geometric phase is
proved for certain adiabatic paths, which correspond to the complete population
return in the rapid-adiabatic passage. A connection is shown between the
geometric phase and a measure of the non-adiabatic effects in the time
evolution of the state vector during SCRAP. Different cost functionals used in
the optimal control scheme are shown to correlate with different topologies of
the paths followed by the parameters of the Hamiltonian, which tightly relates
to the values of the geometric phase acquired by the adiabatic wavefunction.

class with fractional diffusion of order $s \in (0,1)$, studies existence and

we realize it as a Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for a problem posed on a

for this extended QVI and then transfer the results to the fractional QVI: This
introduces a new paradigm in the field of fractional QVIs. Further, we truncate
the semi-infinite cylinder and show that the solution to the truncated problem
converges to the solution of the extended problem, under fairly mild
assumptions, as the truncation parameter $\tau$ tends to infinity. Since the
constraint set changes with the solution, we develop an argument using Mosco
convergence. We state an algorithm to solve the truncated problem and show its
convergence in function space. Finally, we conclude with several illustrative

tessellation of the two-dimensional domain such that the intersection of any

the measurement of electron scattering off high-momentum nucleons in nuclei.
The inclusive 4He/3He cross section ratio is observed to be both x and Q2
independent for 1.5 < x < 2, confirming the dominance of two- nucleon (2N)
short-range correlations (SRCs). For x > 2, our data do not support a previous
claim of three-nucleon (3N) correlation dominance. While contributions beyond
those from stationary 2N- SRCs are observed, our data show that isolating
3N-SRCs is more complicated than for 2N-SRCs.

clandestine or illicit in nature, and hence where individuals operate under
fear of exposure or capture. Yet there is little theoretical understanding of
what models best describe the resulting dynamics. Here we address this gap, by
analyzing the evolutionary dynamics of the supporters behind the 95 pro-ISIS
online communities (i.e. self-organized social media groups) that appeared
recently on a global social media site. We show that although they do not
follow a conventional (i.e. size-based) preferential attachment (PA) model,
their dynamical evolution can be explained by a new variant that we introduce
here, which we refer to as active attraction model (AA). This AA model takes
into account the locality and group heterogeneity which undoubtedly feature in
humans' online behavior under pressure, but which are not contained in
conventional PA models. The AA model captures both group-specific and
macroscopic observations over all size ranges -- as opposed to just the tail
for large groups or groups' initial growth -- suggesting that heterogeneity and
locality play a crucial role in the dynamics of online extremist support. We
derive approximate expressions for the group size distributions in two simple
systems that involve simultaneously the mechanisms of group joining (governed
by either PA or AA), group leaving, and account banning, and show how these
processes influence the group size distributions. We believe this work will
serve in helping understand a broad spectrum of online human activities which
are either clandestine or illicit in nature, and hence where individuals
operate under fear of exposure or capture.

dogged by a powerful numerical instability, which arises from the constraint
that CRs can only stream down their gradient. The standard cure is to
regularize by adding artificial diffusion. Besides introducing ad-hoc
smoothing, this has a significant negative impact on either computational cost
or complexity and parallel scalings. We describe a new numerical algorithm for
CR transport, with close parallels to two moment methods for radiative transfer
under the reduced speed of light approximation. It stably and robustly handles
CR streaming without any artificial diffusion. It allows for both isotropic and
field-aligned CR streaming and diffusion, with arbitrary streaming and
diffusion coefficients. CR transport is handled explicitly, while source terms
are handled implicitly. The overall time-step scales linearly with resolution
(even when computing CR diffusion), and has a perfect parallel scaling. It is
given by the standard Courant condition with respect to a constant maximum
velocity over the entire simulation domain. The computational cost is
comparable to that of solving the ideal MHD equation. We demonstrate the
accuracy and stability of this new scheme with a wide variety of tests,
including anisotropic streaming and diffusion tests, CR modified shocks, CR
driven blast waves, and CR transport in multi-phase media. The new algorithm
opens doors to much more ambitious and hitherto intractable calculations of CR
physics in galaxies and galaxy clusters. It can also be applied to other
physical processes with similar mathematical structure, such as saturated,
anisotropic heat conduction.

serious congestion problems during peak traffic hours in the near future with
the rapid growth of plug-in electric vehicle population. Considering that
drivers' time costs are usually expensive, charging congestion will be a

Earth's orbit (1 AU) to Mars (~ 1.5 AU) has been studied with their propagation
speed estimated from both measurements and simulations. The enhancement of
magnetic fields related to ICMEs and their shock fronts cause the so-called
Forbush decrease, which can be de- tected as a reduction of galactic cosmic
rays measured on-ground. We have used galactic cosmic ray (GCR) data from
in-situ measurements at Earth, from both STEREO A and B as well as GCR
measurements by the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) instrument onboard Mars
Science Laboratory (MSL) on the surface of Mars. A set of ICME events has been
selected during the periods when Earth (or STEREO A or B) and Mars locations
were nearly aligned on the same side of the Sun in the ecliptic plane
(so-called opposition phase). Such lineups allow us to estimate the ICMEs'
transit times between 1 and 1.5 AU by estimating the delay time of the
corresponding Forbush decreases measured at each location. We investigate the
evolution of their propagation speeds before and after passing Earth's orbit
and find that the deceleration of ICMEs due to their interaction with the
ambient solar wind may continue beyond 1 AU. We also find a substantial
variance of the speed evolution among different events revealing the dynamic
and diverse nature of eruptive solar events. Furthermore, the results are
compared to simulation data obtained from two CME propagation models, namely
the Drag-Based Model and ENLIL plus cone model.

lepton mass matrices in fractal universe under permutation symmetry is
discussed. The proposed theory opens an unexpected window on the physics beyond

Yet
the physical nature of these two phenomena remains a mystery. Einstein
suggested a long-forgotten solution: gravitationally repulsive negative masses,
which drive cosmic expansion and cannot coalesce into light-emitting
structures. However, contemporary cosmological results are derived upon the
reasonable assumption that the Universe only contains positive masses. By
reconsidering this assumption, I have constructed a toy model which suggests
that both dark phenomena can be unified into a single negative mass fluid. The
model is a modified $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, and indicates that
continuously-created negative masses can resemble the cosmological constant and
can flatten the rotation curves of galaxies. The model leads to a cyclic
universe with a time-variable Hubble parameter, potentially providing
compatibility with the current tension that is emerging in cosmological
measurements. In the first three-dimensional N-body simulations of negative
mass matter in the scientific literature, this exotic material naturally forms
haloes around galaxies that extend to several galactic radii. These haloes are
not cuspy. The proposed cosmological model is therefore able to predict the
observed distribution of dark matter in galaxies from first principles. The
model makes several testable predictions and seems to have the potential to be
consistent with observational evidence from distant supernovae, the cosmic
microwave background, and galaxy clusters. These findings may imply that
negative masses are a real and physical aspect of our Universe, or
alternatively may imply the existence of a superseding theory that in some
limit can be modelled by effective negative masses. Both cases lead to the
surprising conclusion that the compelling puzzle of the dark Universe may have
been due to a simple sign error.

conceptually interesting problem of what is the probability that a triangle is
obtuse. This is resolved by three kissing cap-circles of rightness being
realized on the shape sphere; integrating up the interiors of these caps
readily yields the answer to be 3/4. We now generalize this approach by viewing
rightness as a particular value of maximal angle, and then covering the shape
sphere with the maximal angle flow. Therein, we discover that the kissing
cap-circles of rightness constitute a separatrix. The two qualitatively
different regimes of behaviour thus separated both moreover carry distinct
analytic pathologies: cusps versus excluded limit points. The equilateral
triangles are centres in this flow, whereas the kissing points themselves --
binary collision shapes -- are more interesting and elaborate critical points.
The other curves' formulae and associated area integrals are more complicated,
and yet remain evaluable. As a particular example, we evaluate the probability
that a triangle is Fermat-acute, meaning that its Fermat point is nontrivially
located; the critical maximal angle in this case is 120 degrees.

thought to be generated via coherent reflection near the characteristic place
of constituent wave components. Because of the tonotopic organization of the
cochlea, high frequency emissions return earlier than low frequencies; however,
due to the random nature of coherent reflection, the instantaneous frequency
(IF) and amplitude envelope of TEOAEs both fluctuate. Multiple reflection
components and synchronized spontaneous emissions can further make it difficult
to extract the IF by linear transforms. In this paper, we propose to model
TEOAEs as a sum of {\em intrinsic mode-type functions} and analyze it by a
{nonlinear-type time-frequency analysis} technique called concentration of
frequency and time (ConceFT). When tested with synthetic OAE signals {with
possibly multiple oscillatory components}, the present method is able to
produce clearly visualized traces of individual components on the
time-frequency plane. Further, when the signal is noisy, the proposed method is
compared with existing linear and bilinear methods in its accuracy for
estimating the fluctuating IF. Results suggest that ConceFT outperforms the
best of these methods in terms of optimal transport distance, reducing the
error by 10 to {21\%} when the signal to noise ratio is 10 dB or below.
