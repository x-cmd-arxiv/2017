G_F^{-1} \omega$, whether in the ordinary matter or the neutrino medium, and on
time/distance scales of order $\omega^{-1}$, where $G_F$ is the Fermi weak
coupling constant and $\omega$ is the vacuum oscillation frequency of the
neutrino. In 2005 Sawyer and more recently both he and other groups have shown
that neutrino flavor conversions can occur on scales much shorter than
$\omega^{-1}$ in a very dense, anisotropic neutrino gas such as that in a
core-collapse supernova or a binary neutron star merger. It has also been
suggested that the fast neutrino flavor conversion require a crossing in the
electron lepton number (ELN) angular distribution or spectrum. We study a few
simple analytical models with which we elucidate the roles of the dense matter
and the ELN spectrum crossing in neutrino fast flavor conversions. We show that
a large matter density can induce fast neutrino flavor conversions in certain
astrophysical scenarios such as at the early epoch of a core-collapse
supernova.

constraining the partition function. We introduce subrings of the known rings
of Weyl invariant Jacobi forms which are adapted to the additional symmetries
of the partition function, making its computation feasible to low base wrapping

benefit of these fast methods. The algorithm consists in properly selecting
random simple paths in the graph and performing the proximal gradient algorithm

particular if the bubble-particle aspect ratio is on the order of 10 or larger.
Hence, it arises the question of both feasibility and reasonability. In this
paper, we present a fully parallel, scalable method for direct numerical
simulation of bubble-particle interaction at a size ratio of 1-2 orders of

challenging, not least because the behaviour happens within computers and
communications networks, but also because data traffic speeds and volumes are
beyond human ability to process. Visualisation is widely used to present
information about the dynamics of network traffic dynamics. Although it
provides operators with an overall view and specific information about
particular traffic or attacks on the network, it often fails to represent the
events in an understandable way. Visualisations require visual attention and so
are not well suited to continuous monitoring scenarios in which network
administrators must carry out other tasks. Situational awareness is critical
and essential for decision-making in the domain of computer network monitoring
where it is vital to be able to identify and recognize network environment
behaviours.Here we present SoNSTAR (Sonification of Networks for SiTuational
AwaReness), a real-time sonification system to be used in the monitoring of
computer networks to support the situational awareness of network
administrators. SoNSTAR provides an auditory representation of all the TCP/IP
protocol traffic within a network based on the different traffic flows between
between network hosts. SoNSTAR raises situational awareness levels for computer
network defence by allowing operators to achieve better understanding and
performance while imposing less workload compared to visual techniques. SoNSTAR
identifies the features of network traffic flows by inspecting the status flags
of TCP/IP packet headers and mapping traffic events to recorded sounds to
generate a soundscape representing the real-time status of the network traffic
environment. Listening to the soundscape allows the administrator to recognise
anomalous behaviour quickly and without having to continuously watch a computer
screen.

three-nucleon forces (3NFs) not only in nuclear matter but also in scattering
between finite-size nuclei. Particularly for the elastic scattering, this study
has just started and the properties are not understood in a wide range of
incident energies ($E_{\rm in}$). We investigate basic properties of chiral
3NFs in nuclear matter with positive energies by using the
Brueckner-Hartree-Fock method with chiral two-nucleon forces of N$^{3}$LO and
3NFs of NNLO, and analyze effects of chiral 3NFs on $^{4}$He elastic scattering
from targets $^{208}$Pb, $^{58}$Ni and $^{40}$Ca over a wide range of $30
\lesssim E_{\rm in}/A_{\rm P} \lesssim 200$ MeV by using the $g$-matrix folding
model, where $A_{\rm P}$ is the mass number of projectile. In symmetric nuclear
matter with positive energies, chiral 3NFs make the single-particle potential
less attractive and more absorptive. The effects mainly come from the
Fujita-Miyazawa 2$\pi$-exchange 3NF and slightly become larger as $E_{\rm in}$
increases. These effects persist in the optical potentials of $^{4}$He
scattering. As for the differential cross sections of $^{4}$He scattering,
chiral-3NF effects are large in $E_{\rm in}/A_{\rm P} \gtrsim 60$ MeV and
improve the agreement of the theoretical results with the measured ones.
Particularly in $E_{\rm in}/A_{\rm P} \gtrsim 100$ MeV, the folding model
reproduces measured differential cross sections pretty well. Cutoff ($\Lambda$)
dependence is investigated for both nuclear matter and $^{4}$He scattering by
considering two cases of $\Lambda=450$ and $550$ MeV. The uncertainty coming
from the dependence is smaller than chiral-3NF effects even at $E_{\rm

simplification of such calculations. We found out and proved for some cases
that $\mathcal{R}_2$-matrices could be transformed into a block-diagonal ones.
The essential condition is that there is a pair of accidentally coinciding
eigenvalues among eigenvalues of $\mathcal{R}_1$-matrix. The angle of the

applied to several combinatorial optimization problems in its zero-temperature

solve the edge-disjoint paths problem and the prize-collecting Steiner tree
problem on graphs have shown remarkable results for several classes of graphs
and for benchmark instances. Here we propose a generalization of these
techniques for two variants of the Steiner trees packing problem where multiple
""interacting"" trees have to be sought within a given graph. Depending on the
interaction among trees we distinguish the vertex-disjoint Steiner trees
problem, where trees cannot share nodes, from the edge-disjoint Steiner trees
problem, where edges cannot be shared by trees but nodes can be members of
multiple trees. Several practical problems of huge interest in network design
can be mapped into these two variants, for instance, the physical design of
Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) chips. The formalism described here relies
on two components edge-variables that allows us to formulate a massage-passing
algorithm for the V-DStP and two algorithms for the E-DStP differing in the
scaling of the computational time with respect to some relevant parameters. We
will show that one of the two formalisms used for the edge-disjoint variant
allow us to map the max-sum update equations into a weighted maximum matching
problem over proper bipartite graphs. We developed a heuristic procedure based
on the max-sum equations that shows excellent performance in synthetic networks
(in particular outperforming standard multi-step greedy procedures by large
margins) and on large benchmark instances of VLSI for which the optimal
solution is known, on which the algorithm found the optimum in two cases and
the gap to optimality was never larger than 4 %.

as defining the consistent closure of system+fluctuations and it can be probed
by the identities satisfied by the correlation functions of the noise fields,
sampled by the action of the commuting fields. This can be done effectively,
through numerical simulations.
  We focus on the case where the target space is invariant under global
rotations, in Euclidian signature, corresponding to global Lorentz
transformations, in Lorentzian signature. This can describe target space
supersymmetry.
  In this case a cross--term, that is a total derivative for abelian
isometries, or when the fields are holomorphic functions of their arguments,
can lead to obstructions. We study its effects and find that, in two
dimensions, it cannot lead to the appearance of the holomorphic anomaly, in any

to their host stars has motivated consideration of $in$ $situ$ formation
models. In particular, Inside-Out Planet Formation is a scenario in which
planets coalesce sequentially in the disk, at the local gas pressure maximum
near the inner boundary of the dead zone. The pressure maximum arises from a
decline in viscosity, going from the active innermost disk (where thermal
ionization of alkalis yields high viscosities via the magneto-rotational
instability (MRI)) to the adjacent dead zone (where the MRI is quenched).
Previous studies of the pressure maximum, based on $\alpha$-disk models, have
assumed ad hoc values for the viscosity parameter $\alpha$ in the active zone,
ignoring the detailed physics of the MRI. Here we explicitly couple the MRI
criteria to the $\alpha$-disk equations, to find steady-state (constant
accretion rate) solutions for the disk structure. We consider the effects of
both Ohmic and ambipolar resistivities, and find solutions for a range of disk
accretion rates ($\dot{M}$ = $10^{-10}$ - $10^{-8}$ ${\rm M}_{\odot}$/yr),
stellar masses ($M_{\ast}$ = 0.1 - 1 ${\rm M}_{\odot}$), and fiducial values of
the $non$-MRI $\alpha$-viscosity in the dead zone ($\alpha_{\rm {DZ}} =
10^{-5}$ - $10^{-3}$). We find that: (1) A midplane pressure maximum forms
radially $outside$ the inner boundary of the dead zone; (2) Hall resistivity
dominates near the midplane in the inner disk, which may explain why close-in
planets do $not$ form in $\sim$50% of systems; (3) X-ray ionization can be
competitive with thermal ionization in the inner disk, because of the low
surface density there in steady-state; and (4) our inner disk solutions are
viscously unstable to surface density perturbations.

Proton-proton collision data taken at centre-of-mass energies of $7$ and

corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $3\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. The

$\varLambda_{b}^{0} \to \varLambda_{c}^{+}\mu^{-}X$ decay chain. In order to
maximize the cancellation of production and detection asymmetries in the

aligned by applying phase-space-dependent weights to the $\varLambda_{c}^{+}

asymmetry to $A_{CP}^{\text{wgt}}(p\pi^{-}\pi^{+})$. Both samples are corrected
for reconstruction and selection efficiencies across the five-dimensional

found to be \begin{align*}

of this relationship to propose a complete linear description of the stable set

obtain a complete description of the dominating set polytope on the same class

$\textit{Swift}$ made important contributions to the discovery and

operational capabilities. These improvements are necessary both for maximizing
the likelihood that $\textit{Swift}$ finds a counterpart, and minimizing the

priorities. We outline areas of improvement to the observing strategy itself

solar surface. In the photosphere, convective motions induce differential
Doppler shifts to spectral lines. The observed convective blueshift varies
across the solar disk. We focus on the impact of solar convection on the
atmosphere and aim to resolve its velocity stratification in the photosphere.
We performed high-resolution spectroscopic observations of the solar spectrum
in the 6302\,\AA\ range with the Laser Absolute Reference Spectrograph (LARS)
at the Vacuum Tower Telescope. A laser frequency comb enabled the calibration
of the spectra to an absolute wavelength scale with an accuracy of ${\rm
1\,m\,s^{-1}}$. We systematically scanned the Quiet Sun from disk center to the
limb at ten selected heliocentric positions. The analysis included 99 time
sequences of up to 20\,min in length. By means of ephemeris and reference
corrections, we translated wavelength shifts into absolute line-of-sight
velocities. A bisector analysis on the line profiles yielded the shapes and
convective shifts of seven photospheric lines. At disk center, the bisector
profiles of the iron lines feature a pronounced C-shape with maximum convective
blueshifts of up to ${\rm -450\,m\,s^{-1}}$ in the spectral line wings. Toward
the solar limb, the bisectors change into a \textbackslash-shape with a
saturation in the line core at a redshift of ${\rm +100\,m\,s^{-1}}$. The
center-to-limb variation of the line core velocities shows a slight increase in
blueshift when departing the disk center for larger heliocentric angles. This
increase in blueshift is more pronounced for the magnetically less active
meridian than for the equator. Toward the solar limb, the blueshift decreases
and can turn into a redshift. Best spectroscopic measurements enabled the
accurate determination of absolute convective shifts in the solar photosphere.

  Sensors",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Micromagnetic sensors play a major role towards the miniaturization in the
industrial society. The adoption of new and emerging sensor technologies like
anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR), giant magnetoresistance (GMR) and tunnel
magnetoresistance (TMR) sensors are mainly driven by their integrability and
enhanced sensitivity. At the core of such sensors, a microstructured
ferromagnetic thin film element transduces the magnetic signal. Such elements
usually switch via multi-domain, C- or S-shaped magnetization states and,
therefore, often exhibit an open non-linear hysteresis curve. Linearity and
hysteretic effects, as well as magnetic noise are key features in the
improvement of such sensors. Here, we report on the physical origin of these
disturbing factors and the inherent connection of noise and hysteresis.
Critical noise sources are identified by means of analytic and micromagnetic
models. The dominant noise source is due to irreproducible magnetic switching
of the transducer element at external fields close to the Stoner Wohlfarth
switching field. Furthermore, a solution is presented to overcome these
limiting factors: a disruptive sensor design is proposed and analyzed which
realizes a topologically protected magnetic vortex state in the transducer
element. Compared to state of the art sensors the proposed sensor layout has
negligible hysteresis, a linear regime about an order of magnitude higher and
lower magnetic noise making the sensor ideal candidate for applications ranging
from automotive industry to biological application.

no impact on the covert throughput as long as the network stays in the

three examples of holomorphic functions which suggest that at least three new

detected in time, recognized, and localized in space. Usually, each of these
tasks is done separately. In this paper, a model-based approach to jointly
carry them out for the case of multiple simultaneous sources is presented and
tested. The recognized event classes and their respective room positions are
obtained with a single system that maximizes the combination of a large set of
scores, each one resulting from a different acoustic event model and a
different beamformer output signal, which comes from one of several
arbitrarily-located small microphone arrays. By using a two-step method, the
experimental work for a specific scenario consisting of meeting-room acoustic
events, either isolated or overlapped with speech, is reported. Tests carried
out with two datasets show the advantage of the proposed approach with respect
to some usual techniques, and that the inclusion of estimated priors brings a
further performance improvement.

effective action, that includes the effect of quantum fluctuations, is a
nonlocal object. These nonlocalities are well understood in the ultraviolet
regime but much less in the infrared, where they could in principle give rise
to important cosmological effects. Here we systematize and extend previous work
of our group, in which it is assumed that a mass scale $\Lambda$ is dynamically
generated in the infrared, giving rise to nonlocal terms in the quantum
effective action of gravity. We give a detailed discussion of conceptual
aspects related to nonlocal gravity and of the cosmological consequences of
these models. The requirement of providing a viable cosmological evolution
severely restricts the form of the nonlocal terms, and selects a model (the
so-called RR model) that corresponds to a dynamical mass generation for the
conformal mode. For such a model: (1) there is a FRW background evolution,
where the nonlocal term acts as an effective dark energy with a phantom
equation of state, providing accelerated expansion without a cosmological
constant. (2) Cosmological perturbations are well behaved. (3) Implementing the
model in a Boltzmann code and comparing with observations we find that the RR
model fits the CMB, BAO, SNe, structure formation data and local $H_0$
measurements at a level statistically equivalent to $\Lambda$CDM. (4) Bayesian
parameter estimation shows that the value of $H_0$ obtained in the RR model is
higher than in $\Lambda$CDM, reducing to $2.0\sigma$ the tension with the value
from local measurements. (5) The RR model provides a prediction for the sum of
neutrino masses that falls within the limits set by oscillation and terrestrial
experiments. (6) Gravitational waves propagate at the speed of light, complying

classical error correcting code, which leads to significant qubit savings

cylinder of viscous liquid under capillary force, the so-called
Plateau-Rayleigh instability. In this work, in linear approximation, he
obtained a dispersion equation describing the increment of this instability as
a function of wavelength, the radius of cylinder, the mass density, surface
tension, and viscosity of the liquid. Hundreds of authors referred to this
work, but none of them used his dispersion equation in its complete form; they
used only the asymptotic solutions of his equation for zero and infinitely
large viscousities. A reason for this is, probably, that Rayleigh's writing is
very difficult and his dispersion equation is quite complex. Then, in 1961, S
Chandrasekhar, in his monograph, also considered the stability of a viscous
cylindrical jet and obtained his dispersion equation which is also quite
complex and differs from the one obtained by Rayleigh. As in the case of
Rayleigh's dispersion equation, other works use only the asymptotic solution of
Chandrasekhar's equation that corresponds to the case where the viscosity is
very large in comparison to inertia. In this paper, I demonstrate that
Chandrasekhar's dispersion equation is equivalent to Rayleigh's and then
simplify their dispersion equations to a form which can be easily solved
numerically for arbitrary values of viscosity. I also present Mathematica code
to calculate the maximum increment of the Plateau-Rayleigh instability for
given parameters of the jet. To illustrate how the code works, I apply it to a
cylindrical jet to estimate its breakup.

optimization, it adopts hybrid OpenMP/MPI/GPU parallelization and utilizes
overlapping CPU computation, GPU computation, and CPU-GPU communication. Load

results obtained by different codes are in very good agreement, and GAMER-2
outperforms Enzo and FLASH by nearly one and two orders of magnitude,

of course considerably more difficult, since there is no obvious way of merging
two closed spin chains into a big one. In an earlier paper, two of us had

establish - using, in particular, Frobenius reciprocity - the resulting fusion
rules for standard modules of ATL in the generic as well as partially
degenerate cases. These fusion rules have a simple interpretation in the

not match the usual fusion in non-chiral CFTs. Rather, it corresponds to the
glueing of the right moving component of one conformal field with the left

A conventional slit spectrograph with a diffraction-limited performance over a
large field of view (FOV) can be built at much lower cost and effort. It can be
converted to an imaging spectro(polari)meter using the concept of a subtractive
double pass (SDP). We demonstrate that an SDP system can reach a similar
performance as FPI-based systems with a high spatial and moderate spectral
resolution across a FOV of 100""x100"" with a spectral coverage of 1 nm. We use
Halpha spectra taken with a SDP system at the Dunn Solar Telescope and
complementary full-disc data to infer the properties of small-scale
superpenumbral filaments. We find that the majority of all filaments end in
patches of opposite-polarity fields. The internal fine-structure in the
line-core intensity of Halpha at spatial scales of about 0.5"" exceeds that in
other parameters such as the line width, indicating small-scale opacity effects
in a larger-scale structure with common properties. We conclude that SDP
systems are a valid alternative to FPI systems when high spatial resolution and
a large FOV are required. They also can reach a cadence that is comparable to
that of FPI systems, while providing a much larger spectral range.

new contents are generated over time (by the user's contacts), and remain
relevant to the user for random lifetimes. The user, equipped with a
finite-capacity cache memory, randomly accesses the system, and requests all
the relevant contents at the time of access. The system incurs an energy cost
associated with the number of contents downloaded and the channel quality at
that time. Assuming causal knowledge of the channel quality, the content
profile, and the user-access behavior, we model the proactive caching problem
as a Markov decision process with the goal of minimizing the long-term average
energy cost. We first prove the optimality of a threshold-based proactive
caching scheme, which dynamically caches or removes appropriate contents from
the memory, prior to being requested by the user, depending on the channel
state. The optimal threshold values depend on the system state, and hence, are
computationally intractable. Therefore, we propose parametric representations

near-optimal parametrizations. We demonstrate through simulations that the

perform very close to a genie-aided lower bound.

requests $R$ online to a given set of servers $S$. The distance metric between
any two points in $R\,\cup\, S$ is a line metric and the objective for the
online algorithm is to minimize the sum of distances between matched
server-request pairs. This problem is well-studied and - despite recent
improvements - there is still a large gap between the best known lower and
upper bounds: The best known deterministic algorithm for the problem is
$O(\log^2n)$-competitive, while the best known deterministic lower bound is
$9.001$. The lower and upper bounds for randomized algorithms are $4.5$ and
$O(\log n)$ respectively.
  We prove that any deterministic online algorithm which in each round: $(i)$
bases the matching decision only on information local to the current request,
and $(ii)$ is symmetric (in the sense that the decision corresponding to the
mirror image of some instance $I$ is the mirror image of the decision
corresponding to instance $I$), must be $\Omega(\log n)$-competitive. We then
extend the result by showing that it also holds when relaxing the symmetry
property so that the algorithm might prefer one side over the other, but only
up to some degree. This proves a barrier of $\Omega(\log n)$ on the competitive
ratio for a large class of ""natural"" algorithms. This class includes all
deterministic online algorithms found in the literature so far.
  Furthermore, we show that our result can be extended to randomized algorithms
that locally induce a symmetric distribution over the chosen servers. The

likelihood learning in end-to-end speech recognition models. However, there is
usually a disparity between the negative maximum likelihood and the performance
metric used in speech recognition, e.g., word error rate (WER). This results in
a mismatch between the objective function and metric during training. We show
that the above problem can be mitigated by jointly training with maximum
likelihood and policy gradient. In particular, with policy learning we are able
to directly optimize on the (otherwise non-differentiable) performance metric.
We show that joint training improves relative performance by 4% to 13% for our
end-to-end model as compared to the same model learned through maximum
likelihood. The model achieves 5.53% WER on Wall Street Journal dataset, and
5.42% and 14.70% on Librispeech test-clean and test-other set, respectively.

dimensional data. The choice of embeddings ranges from highly non-linear ones,
which can capture complex relationships but are difficult to interpret

are limited to bivariate relationships. Linear project can be considered as a
compromise between complexity and interpretability, as they allow explicit axes
labels, yet provide significantly more degrees of freedom compared to
axis-aligned projections. Nevertheless, interpreting the axes directions, which
are linear combinations often with many non-trivial components, remains
difficult. To address this problem we introduce a structure aware decomposition
of (multiple) linear projections into sparse sets of axis aligned projections,
which jointly capture all information of the original linear ones. In
particular, we use tools from Dempster-Shafer theory to formally define how
relevant a given axis aligned project is to explain the neighborhood relations
displayed in some linear projection. Furthermore, we introduce a new approach
to discover a diverse set of high quality linear projections and show that in
practice the information of $k$ linear projections is often jointly encoded in
$\sim k$ axis aligned plots. We have integrated these ideas into an interactive
visualization system that allows users to jointly browse both linear
projections and their axis aligned representatives. Using a number of case
studies we show how the resulting plots lead to more intuitive visualizations

instantaneously spreads mass to every point in its domain. The resulting

optimal. The proof of mass-spreading is based on a stochastic process
associated to the equation, and makes essential use of nonlocality. By
combining this theorem with prior regularity results, we derive two important
applications: $C^\infty$ smoothing in all three variables, even for initial
data with vacuum regions, and a continuation criterion that states the solution
can be extended for as long as the mass and energy densities stay bounded from

it does not require a lower bound on the mass density or an upper bound on the

significantly bias dark energy constraints. As the detailed physics of the
baryons is not yet well-understood, correcting for baryon effects introduces
additional parameters which must be marginalized over, increasing the
uncertainties on the inferred cosmological parameters. Forthcoming weak lensing
surveys are aiming for percent-level precision on the dark energy equation of
state, so the problem must be thoroughly examined. We use a halo model with
analytic modifications which capture the impact of adiabatic contraction of
baryons and feedback on the matter power spectrum, and generalize the
Navarro-Frenk-White profile to account for a possible inner core. A Fisher
analysis predicts degradations of 40% in the $w_0$-$w_a$ Figure of Merit for a
Euclid-like survey, and up to 80% for other cosmological parameters. We
forecast potential inner core constraints of a few $\mathrm{kpc}$, while for a
fixed inner core, adiabatic concentration and feedback parameters are
constrained to a few percent. We explore the scales where baryons and dark
energy contribute most to the Fisher information, finding that probing to
increasingly non-linear scales does little to reduce degradation. Including
external baryon information improves our forecasts, but limiting degradation to
1% requires strong priors. Adding Planck cosmic microwave background priors
improves the Figure of Merit by a factor of 2.7 and almost completely recovers
the individual marginalized errors on $w_0$ and $w_a$. We also quantify the

observables which form a discrete linear basis for all infrared- and
collinear-safe observables. Energy flow polynomials are multiparticle energy
correlators with specific angular structures that are a direct consequence of
infrared and collinear safety. We establish a powerful graph-theoretic
representation of the energy flow polynomials which allows us to design
efficient algorithms for their computation. Many common jet observables are
exact linear combinations of energy flow polynomials, and we demonstrate the
linear spanning nature of the energy flow basis by performing regression for
several common jet observables. Using linear classification with energy flow
polynomials, we achieve excellent performance on three representative jet
tagging problems: quark/gluon discrimination, boosted W tagging, and boosted
top tagging. The energy flow basis provides a systematic framework for complete
investigations of jet substructure using linear methods.

been made in modeling their propagation in the Galaxy and in the Heliosphere.
However, propagation models suffer from degeneracy of many parameters. To
complicate the picture the precision of recent data have started challenging
existing models.
  To tackle these issues we use available multifrequency observations of the
interstellar emission from radio to gamma rays, together with direct CR
measurements, to study local interstellar spectra (LIS) and propagation models.
  As a result, the electron LIS is characterized without any assumption on
solar modulation, and favorite propagation models are put forward. More
precisely, our analysis leads to the following main conclusions: (1) the
electron injection spectrum needs at least a break below a few GeV; (2) even
though consistent with direct CR measurements, propagation models producing a
LIS with large all-electron density from a few hundreds of MeV to a few GeV are
disfavored by both radio and gamma-ray observations; (3) the usual assumption
that direct CR measurements, after accounting for solar modulation, are
representative of the proton LIS in our ~1 kpc region is challenged by the
observed local gamma-ray HI emissivity.
  We provide the resulting proton LIS, all-electron LIS, and propagation
parameters, based on synchrotron, gamma-ray, and direct CR data. A plain
diffusion model and a tentative diffusive-reacceleration model are put forward.
The various models are investigated in the inner-Galaxy region in X-rays and
gamma rays. Predictions of the interstellar emission for future gamma-ray
instruments (e-ASTROGAM and AMEGO) are derived.

observational results from the CARLA survey. Our model shows that the
differences in environment are due to radio galaxies being hosted by dark
matter haloes that are ~1.5 dex more massive than those hosting radio-quiet
galaxies with the same stellar mass. By running a control-simulation in which
AGN feedback is switched-off, we identify AGN feedback as the primary mechanism
affecting the build-up of the stellar component of radio galaxies, thus
explaining the different environment in radio galaxies and their radio-quiet
counterparts. The difference in host halo mass between radio loud and radio
quiet galaxies translates into different galaxies populating each environment.
We predict a higher fraction of passive galaxies around radio loud galaxies
compared to their radio-quiet counterparts. Furthermore, such a high fraction
of passive galaxies shapes the predicted infrared luminosity function in the
environment of radio galaxies in a way that is consistent with observational
findings. Our results suggest that the impact of AGN feedback at high redshifts

longitudinal stochastic gravitational waves. Paradoxically however, we find
that longitudinal modes will be very difficult to detect due to the large

lot of attention in the fields of both astrophysics and particle physics. It

from purely conventional astrophysical sources or from the late decay of a
super heavy (PeV scale) dark matter (DM) particle. In order for decaying DM to
be a dominant source of the IceCube high-energy neutrinos, it would require an
unusually suppressed value of the coupling of DM to neutrinos. We attempt to
explain this small coupling in the context of an $R$-parity conserving minimal
supergravity model which has right-handed neutrino superfields. With the main
assumptions of super-partner masses at the PeV scale and also a reheating
temperature not much larger than the PeV scale, we find in our model several

freeze-in as a DM candidate with the correct relic density (ii) the

gravitino and neutrinos is such that it naturally predicts the right
order-of-magnitude for the IceCube neutrino flux. The long lifetime of the RH
sneutrino is explained by the existence of a global $R$-symmetry which is only
broken due to supersymmetry breaking effects. Our model also predicts a flux of
100 TeV gamma rays from the decaying RH sneutrino which are within the current
observational constraints.

resonance at the neutral-wino-pair threshold, low-energy winos can be described
by a zero-range effective field theory (ZREFT) in which the winos interact
nonperturbatively through a contact interaction and through Coulomb
interactions. The effects of wino-pair annihilation into electroweak gauge
bosons are taken into account through the analytic continuation of the real
parameters for the contact interaction to complex values. The parameters of
ZREFT can be determined by matching wino-wino scattering amplitudes calculated
by solving the Schr\""odinger equation for winos interacting through a real
potential due to the exchange of electroweak gauge bosons and an imaginary
potential due to wino-pair annihilation into electroweak gauge bosons. ZREFT at
leading order gives an accurate analytic description of low-energy wino-wino
scattering, inclusive wino-pair annihilation, and a wino-pair bound state.
ZREFT can also be applied to partial annihilation rates, such as the Sommerfeld
enhancement of the annihilation rate of wino pairs into monochromatic photons.

system coupled with a massless scalar field prepared in one of the physical
vacuum states of interest. We employ the quantum master equation in the
Born-Markov approximation in order to describe the time evolution of the atomic
subsystem. We investigate two different states of motion for the atoms, namely
static atoms and also stationary atoms with zero angular momentum. The purpose
of this work is to expound the impact on the creation of entanglement coming
from the combined action of the different physical processes underlying the
Hawking effect and the Unruh-Starobinskii effect. We demonstrate that, in the
scenario of rotating black holes, the degree of quantum entanglement is
significantly modified due to the phenomenon of superradiance in comparison
with the analogous cases in a Schwarzschild spacetime. In the perspective of a
zero angular momentum observer (ZAMO), one is allowed to probe entanglement
dynamics inside the ergosphere, since static observers cannot exist within such
a region. On the other hand, the presence of superradiant modes could be a
source for violation of complete positivity. This is verified when the quantum
field is prepared in the Frolov-Thorne vacuum state. In this exceptional
situation, we raise the possibility that the loss of complete positivity is due
to the breakdown of the Markovian approximation, which means that any arbitrary
physically admissible initial state of the two atoms would not be capable to
hold, with time evolution, its interpretation as a physical state inasmuch as
negative probabilities are generated by the dynamical map.

chain lengths akin to what is observed for worm-like micellar systems. On
increasing particle density the polymeric chains self-organize to an ordered
line-hexagonal phase where every chain is surrounded by six parallel chains,
the transition is first order. On further increase in monomer density, the
order is destroyed and we get a branched gel like phase. This potential can be
used to model semi-flexible equilibrium polymers with tunable semiflexibility
and excluded volume. The use of the potential is computationally cheap and
hence, can be used to simulate and probe complex micellar dynamics with long
chains. The potential also gives a plausible method of tuning colloidal
interactions in experiments such that one can obtain self-assembling polymeric
chains made up of colloids and probe polymer dynamics using an optical

Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (H-ATLAS). In this work, we describe
the identification of optical and near-infrared counterparts to the
submillimetre detected sources in the $177$ deg$^2$ North Galactic Plane (NGP)
field. We used the likelihood ratio method to identify counterparts in the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey and in the UKIRT Imaging Deep Sky Survey within a
search radius of $10$ arcsec of the H-ATLAS sources with a $4\sigma$ detection
at $250 \, \mu$m. We obtained reliable ($R \ge 0.8 $) optical counterparts with
$r< 22.4$ for 42429 H-ATLAS sources ($37.8$ per cent), with an estimated
completeness of $71.7$ per cent and a false identification rate of $4.7$ per
cent. We also identified counterparts in the near-infrared using deeper
$K$-band data which covers a smaller $\sim25$ deg$^2$. We found reliable
near-infrared counterparts to $61.8$ per cent of the $250$-$\mu$m-selected
sources within that area. We assessed the performance of the likelihood ratio
method to identify optical and near-infrared counterparts taking into account
the depth and area of both input catalogues. Using catalogues with the same
surface density of objects in the overlapping $\sim25$ deg$^2$ area, we
obtained that the reliable fraction in the near-infrared ($54.8$ per cent) is
significantly higher than in the optical ($36.4$ per cent). Finally, using deep
radio data which covers a small region of the NGP field, we found that $80 -
90$ per cent of our reliable identifications are correct.

representation of the past is necessary to predict the future. However, perfect
storage of all experiences is not feasible. One approach utilized in many
applications, including reward prediction in reinforcement learning, is to
retain recently active features of experience in a buffer. Despite its prior
successes, we show that the fixed length buffer renders Deep Q-learning
Networks (DQNs) fragile to changes in the scale over which information can be
learned. To enable learning when the relevant temporal scales in the
environment are not known *a priori*, recent advances in psychology and
neuroscience suggest that the brain maintains a compressed representation of
the past. Here we introduce a neurally-plausible, scale-free memory
representation we call Scale-Invariant Temporal History (SITH) for use with
artificial agents. This representation covers an exponentially large period of
time by sacrificing temporal accuracy for events further in the past. We
demonstrate the utility of this representation by comparing the performance of
agents given SITH, buffer, and exponential decay representations in learning to
play video games at different levels of complexity. In these environments, SITH
exhibits better learning performance by storing information for longer
timescales than a fixed-size buffer, and representing this information more
clearly than a set of exponentially decayed features. Finally, we discuss how
the application of SITH, along with other human-inspired models of cognition,
could improve reinforcement and machine learning algorithms in general.

concepts to demonstrate the non-Abelian character of Majorana fermions. Its
physical properties are strongly affected by the intimate interplay of
intrinsic quantum fluctuations and environmentally-induced quantum fluctuations
each of which promoting different Cooper pair transport mechanisms at small
voltages around zero. To shed light on the detailed transport mechanisms
occurring in this type of junction, we performed voltage-biased measurements on
the small-capacitance Josephson junction of a scanning tunneling microscope at
milli-Kelvin temperatures. The low voltage-regime of experimental
current-voltage characteristics can be modeled by the two complementary
descriptions of phase coherent and incoherent Cooper pair transport, signaling
the occurrence of qualitatively different transport mechanisms. This
observation receives further support from analyzing the calculated Fano factor
of the current noise as a probe for correlations in Cooper pair transport,
following a theoretical proposal. Together our experimental observations and
related data analysis provide a clear signature of coherent Cooper pair
transport along with the absence of perfect charge quantized transport around

passive tracer to produce small filamentation length scales. In addition,
diffusion is generally perceived as beneficial to mixing due to its ability to
homogenise a passive tracer. However we provided numerical evidence that, in
the case where advection and diffusion are both actively present, diffusion
produces nearly neutral or even negative effects by limiting the mixing
effectiveness of incompressible optimal flows. This limitation appears to be
due to the presence of a limiting length scale given by a generalised Batchelor
length. This length scale limitation in turn affects long-term mixing rates.
More specifically, we consider local-in-time flow optimisation under energy and
enstrophy flow constraints with the objective of maximising mixing rate
performance. We observe that, for enstrophy-bounded optimal flows, the strength
of diffusion has no impact on the long-term mixing rate performance. For
energy-constrained optimal flows, however an increase in the strength of

moments to point in any direction in the $C_2$ phase, they restrict the
possible moment orientations in the $C_4$ phases. As a result, an interesting
scenario arises in which the spin anisotropic interactions favor a $C_2$ phase,
but the other spin isotropic interactions favor a $C_4$ phase. We study this
frustration via both mean-field and renormalization-group approaches. We find
that, to lift this frustration, a rich magnetic landscape emerges well below
the magnetic transition temperature, with novel $C_2$, $C_4$, and mixed
$C_2$-$C_4$ phases. Near the putative magnetic quantum critical point, spin
anisotropies promote a stable Gaussian fixed point in the renormalization-group

near-degeneracy between $C_2$ and $C_4$ phases. We argue that this frustration
is the reason why most $C_4$ phases in the iron pnictides only appear inside

gravitational interactions between the giant planets and a massive primordial
planetesimal disk, leading to a successful reproduction of the solar system's
present-day architecture. In typical realizations of the Nice model,
self-gravity of the planetesimal disk is routinely neglected, as it poses a
computational bottleneck to the calculations. Recent analyses have shown,
however, that a self-gravitating disk can exhibit behavior that is dynamically
distinct, and this disparity may have significant implications for the solar
system's evolutionary path. In this work, we explore this discrepancy utilizing
a large suite of Nice odel simulations with and without a self-gravitating
planetesimal disk, taking advantage of the inherently parallel nature of
graphic processing units. Our simulations demonstrate that self-consistent
modeling of particle interactions does not lead to significantly different
final planetary orbits from those obtained within conventional simulations.

non-self-gravitating numerical experiments after dynamical instability is

group-based methods. This relationship can be calculated theoretically for

structures and densities of states are computed using density functional
theory, hybrid functionals, and the $GW$ approximation. Accurate optical
absorption spectra and exciton binding energies are computed by solving the
Bethe-Salpeter equation for the optical polarization function. Using this data
we show that the band-gap difference between BN-ZnO and wurtzite (WZ) ZnO
agrees very well with experiment when the theoretical lattice geometry is used,
but significantly disagrees for the experimental atomic coordinates. We also
show that the optical anisotropy of BN-ZnO differs significantly from that of
WZ-ZnO, allowing to optically distinguish both polymorphs. By using the
transfer-matrix method to solve Maxwell's equations for thin films composed of
both polymorphs, we illustrate that this opens up a promising route for tuning
optical properties.

they are to divide up a resource $\nu$ that is also on a continuum. The utility
to each player is determined by the exponential of a distance type function.
The maximization problem becomes an optimal transport type problem, where the
target density is the minimizer to the functional \[
F(\beta)=H_{\nu}(\beta)+W^{2}(\mu,\beta) \] where $H_{\nu}(\beta)$ is the
entropy and $W^{2}$ is the 2-Wasserstein distance. This minimization problem is
also solved in the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto scheme. Thanks to optimal transport
theory, the solution may be described by a potential that solves a fourth order
nonlinear elliptic PDE, similar to Abreu's equation. Using the PDE, we prove
solutions are smooth when the measures have smooth positive densities.

problem from a multi-instance learning perspective. Real-world sequential data
commonly show discriminative patterns only at specific time periods. For
instance, we can identify a cropland during its growing season, but it looks
similar to a barren land after harvest or before planting. Besides, even within
the same class, the discriminative patterns can appear in different periods of
sequential data. Due to such property, these discriminative patterns are also
referred to as shifting patterns. The shifting patterns in sequential data
severely degrade the performance of traditional classification methods without
sufficient training data.
  We propose a novel sequence classification method by automatically mining
shifting patterns from multi-variate sequence. The method employs a
multi-instance learning approach to detect shifting patterns while also
modeling temporal relationships within each multi-instance bag by an LSTM model
to further improve the classification performance. We extensively evaluate our
method on two real-world applications - cropland mapping and affective state
recognition. The experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method

Graph-based design languages use the Unified-Modeling-Language (UML) to define
the product entities (classes) supporting object-oriented inheritance.
Graphical rules instantiate the classes and iteratively assemble the central
model. This paper proposes to extend the design languages by introducing
methods (operations). This allows the use of object-oriented design patterns
and interface mechanisms as object-oriented principles are then fully
implemented. A graphical mechanism to model the method calls is presented which
integrates seamlessly into the graph-based design language's graphical rule

enhanced and multistakeholder collaboration with access control (information

through a quantum superconductor to metal transition (QSMT) by tuning physical
parameters such as the magnetic field, the gate voltage in the case of systems

phenomenological observation is that in the anomalous metal, as a function of
decreasing temperature, the resistivity first drops as if the system were
approaching a superconducting ground state, but then saturates at low
temperatures to a value that can be orders of magnitude smaller than the Drude
value. The anomalous metal also shows a giant positive magneto-resistance.
Thus, it behaves as if it were a ""failed superconductor."" This behavior is
observed in a broad range of parameters. We moreover exhibit, by theoretical
solution of a model of superconducting grains embedded in a metallic matrix,
that as a matter of principle such anomalous metallic behavior can occur in the
neighborhood of a QSMT. However, we also argue that the robustness and

also the electrical and magnetic properties of the ribbons are strongly
dependent on the edge configuration. We have studied two categories of ribbons:
XBNRs, and YBNRs. The first one is a nonmagnetic metal with armchair shape
edge, while YBNRs can be magnetic or nonmagnetic related to the edge shape.
YBNRs have four different edge types and we show that two of them are magnetic
( a- and b-type edges) but others are nonmagnetic (c- and d-type edges). There
are 10 distinct configurations by arranging the different edges of YBNRs. 10
percent of YBNRs are polarized asymmetrically at the edges leading to the loss
of degeneracy of spin-up and spin-down bands in the antiferromagnetic
configuration. 40 percent of YBNRs have one magnetic edge which can be a
promising candidate for spintronic applications due to the separation of the
spin in the real space in addition to the energy space. Electronic transmission

  Caching Networks","32 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider wireless device-to-device (D2D) caching networks with single-hop
transmissions. Previous work has demonstrated that caching and coded
multicasting can significantly increase per user throughput. However, the
state-of-the-art coded caching schemes for D2D networks are generally
impractical because content files are partitioned into an exponential number of
packets with respect to the number of users if both library and memory sizes
are fixed. In this paper, we present two combinatorial approaches of D2D coded
caching network design with reduced packetizations and desired throughput gain
compared to the conventional uncoded unicasting. The first approach uses a
""hypercube"" design, where each user caches a ""hyperplane"" in this hypercube and
the intersections of ""hyperplanes"" represent coded multicasting codewords. In
addition, we extend the hypercube approach to a decentralized design. The
second approach uses the Ruzsa-Szem\'eredi graph to define the cache placement.
Disjoint matchings on this graph represent coded multicasting codewords. Both
approaches yield an exponential reduction of packetizations while providing a
per-user throughput that is comparable to the state-of-the-art designs in the
literature. Furthermore, we apply spatial reuse to the new D2D network designs
to further reduce the required packetizations and significantly improve per
user throughput for some parameter regimes.

Traditionally, a user poses a query to a search engine that returns an answer
based on its index, possibly leveraging external knowledge bases and
conditioning the response on earlier interactions in the search session. In a
natural conversation, there is an additional source of information to take into
account: utterances produced earlier in a conversation can also be referred to
and a conversational IR system has to keep track of information conveyed by the
user during the conversation, even if it is implicit.
  We argue that the process of building a representation of the conversation
can be framed as a machine reading task, where an automated system is presented
with a number of statements about which it should answer questions. The
questions should be answered solely by referring to the statements provided,
without consulting external knowledge. The time is right for the information
retrieval community to embrace this task, both as a stand-alone task and
integrated in a broader conversational search setting.
  In this paper, we focus on machine reading as a stand-alone task and present
the Attentive Memory Network (AMN), an end-to-end trainable machine reading
algorithm. Its key contribution is in efficiency, achieved by having an
hierarchical input encoder, iterating over the input only once. Speed is an
important requirement in the setting of conversational search, as gaps between
conversational turns have a detrimental effect on naturalness. On 20 datasets
commonly used for evaluating machine reading algorithms we show that the AMN
achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art models, while using
considerably fewer computations.

accurate exploration of chemical space and simulation of large reactive

physical detail, especially long-range forces. At short range, however, these
models are data driven and data limited. Little is systematically known about
how data should be sampled, and `test data' chosen randomly from some sampling
techniques can provide poor information about generality. If the sampling
method is narrow `test error' can appear encouragingly tiny while the model
fails catastrophically elsewhere. In this manuscript we competitively evaluate
two common sampling methods: molecular dynamics (MD), normal-mode sampling
(NMS) and one uncommon alternative, Metadynamics (MetaMD), for preparing
training geometries. We show that MD is an inefficient sampling method in the
sense that additional samples do not improve generality. We also show MetaMD is
easily implemented in any NNMC software package with cost that scales linearly
with the number of atoms in a sample molecule. MetaMD is a black-box way to
ensure samples always reach out to new regions of chemical space, while
remaining relevant to chemistry near $k_bT$. It is one cheap tool to address
the issue of generalization.

$\mathbb{R}^p$. The algorithm involves performing random 1-dimensional
projections until a direction is found that yields a user-specified clustering
error $e$. For a 1-dimensional separation parameter $\gamma$ satisfying
$\gamma=Q^{-1}(e)$, the expected number of such projections is shown to be
bounded by $o(\ln p)$, when $\gamma$ satisfies $\gamma\leq
c\sqrt{\ln{\ln{p}}}$, with $c$ as the separability parameter of the two
Gaussians in $\mathbb{R}^p$. Consequently, the expected overall running time of
the algorithm is linear in $n$ and quasi-linear in $p$ at $o(\ln{p})O(np)$, and
the sample complexity is independent of $p$. This result stands in contrast to
prior works which provide polynomial, with at-best quadratic, running time in
$p$ and $n$. We show that our bound on the expected number of 1-dimensional
projections extends to the case of three or more Gaussian components, and we
present a generalization of our results to mixture distributions beyond the
Gaussian model.

  Bioinformatics Conference",,,,"q-bio.BM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Background. Protein dihedral angles provide a detailed description of protein
local conformation. Predicted dihedral angles can be used to narrow down the
conformational space of the whole polypeptide chain significantly, thus aiding
protein tertiary structure prediction. However, direct angle prediction from
sequence alone is challenging.
  Method. In this study, we present a novel method to predict real-valued
angles by combining clustering and deep learning. That is, we first generate
certain clusters of angles (each assigned a label) and then apply a deep
residual neural network to predict the label posterior probability. Finally, we
output real-valued prediction by a mixture of the clusters with their predicted
probabilities. At the same time, we also estimate the bound of the prediction
errors at each residue from the predicted label probabilities.
  Result. In this article, we present a novel method (named RaptorX-Angle) to
predict real-valued angles by combining clustering and deep learning. Tested on
a subset of PDB25 and the targets in the latest two Critical Assessment of
protein Structure Prediction (CASP), our method outperforms the existing
state-of-art method SPIDER2 in terms of Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC)
and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Our result also shows approximately linear
relationship between the real prediction errors and our estimated bounds. That
is, the real prediction error can be well approximated by our estimated bounds.
  Conclusions. Our study provides an alternative and more accurate prediction
of dihedral angles, which may facilitate protein structure prediction and
functional study.

the system, the CAS-DMET is in a good agreement with CASSCF for the geometries
around the equilibrium, but not in equal agreement at bond dissociation.

  (2) We show that if one applies a generalization of the known techniques

$n$, with $i < n$. A conjecture of Gerstenhaber and Giaquinto states that the

The DMF is derived using the density corrected $V_{\rm max}$ method, where we
estimate $V_{\rm max}$ using: (i) the normal photometric selection limit
($pV_{\rm max}$) and (ii) a bivariate brightness distribution (BBD) technique,
which accounts for two selection effects. We fit the data with a Schechter
function, and find $M^{*}=(4.65\pm0.18)\times 10^{7}\,h^2_{70}\, M_{\odot}$,
$\alpha=(1.22\pm 0.01)$, $\phi^{*}=(6.26\pm 0.28)\times 10^{-3}\,h^3_{70}\,\rm
Mpc^{-3}\,dex^{-1}$. The resulting dust mass density parameter integrated down
to $10^4\,M_{\odot}$ is $\Omega_{\rm d}=(1.11 \pm0.02)\times 10^{-6}$ which
implies the mass fraction of baryons in dust is $f_{m_b}=(2.40\pm0.04)\times
10^{-5}$; cosmic variance adds an extra 7-17\,per\,cent uncertainty to the
quoted statistical errors. Our measurements have fewer galaxies with high dust
mass than predicted by semi-analytic models. This is because the models include
too much dust in high stellar mass galaxies. Conversely, our measurements find
more galaxies with high dust mass than predicted by hydrodynamical cosmological
simulations. This is likely to be from the long timescales for grain growth
assumed in the models. We calculate DMFs split by galaxy type and find dust
mass densities of $\Omega_{\rm d}=(0.88\pm0.03)\times 10^{-6}$ and $\Omega_{\rm
d}=(0.060\pm0.005)\times 10^{-6}$ for late-types and early-types respectively.
Comparing to the equivalent galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMF) we find that
the DMF for late-types is well matched by the GMSF scaled by $(8.07\pm0.35)
\times 10^{-4}$.

end-to-end deep auto-encoder is proposed to address unsupervised learning

enforced to promote local structures on top of PointNet. Then, a novel
folding-based decoder deforms a canonical 2D grid onto the underlying 3D object
surface of a point cloud, achieving low reconstruction errors even for objects
with delicate structures. The proposed decoder only uses about 7% parameters of
a decoder with fully-connected neural networks, yet leads to a more
discriminative representation that achieves higher linear SVM classification
accuracy than the benchmark. In addition, the proposed decoder structure is
shown, in theory, to be a generic architecture that is able to reconstruct an
arbitrary point cloud from a 2D grid. Our code is available at

tool in theoretical computer sciences to obtain structural results about
computational problems and complexity classes by indirect proofs. The Uniform
Diagonalization Theorem allows the construction of problems outside complexity
classes while still being reducible to a specific decision problem. This paper
provides a generalization of the Uniform Diagonalization Theorem by extending
it to promise problems and the complexity classes they form, e.g. randomized
and quantum complexity classes. The theorem requires from the underlying
computing model not only the decidability of its acceptance and rejection
behaviour but also of its promise-contradicting indifferent behaviour - a
property that we will introduce as ""total decidability"" of promise problems.
  Implications of the Uniform Diagonalization Theorem are mainly of two kinds:
1. Existence of intermediate problems (e.g. between BQP and QMA) - also known
as Ladner's Theorem - and 2. Undecidability if a problem of a complexity class
is contained in a subclass (e.g. membership of a QMA-problem in BQP). Like the
original Uniform Diagonalization Theorem the extension applies besides BQP and
QMA to a large variety of complexity class pairs, including combinations from

magnetic vortex-core switching via external magnetic fields, spin-polarized

novel spin configurations that could emerge from the ground states in
ferromagnetic disks and their underlying dynamics. Here, we report in situ
visualization of femtosecond laser quenching induced magnetic vortex change in
various symmetric ferromagnetic Permalloy disks by Lorentz phase imaging using
4D electron microscopy. Besides the switching of magnetic vortex chirality and
polarity, we observed with distinct occurrence frequencies a plenitude of
complex magnetic structures that have never been observed by magnetic field or
current assisted switching. These complex magnetic structures consist of a
number of newly created topological magnetic defects (vortex and antivortex)
strictly conserving the topological winding number, demonstrating the direct
impact of topological invariant on the magnetization dynamics in ferromagnetic
disks. Their spin configurations show mirror or rotation symmetry due to the
geometrical confinement of the disks. Combined micromagnetic simulations with
the experimental observations reveal the underlying magnetization dynamics and
formation mechanism of the optical quenching induced complex magnetic
structures. Their distinct occurrence rates are pertinent to their
formation-growth energetics and pinning effects at the disk edge. Based on

overlook the simultaneous and reciprocal nature of causal interactions observed
in real world phenomena. Here, we present a causal decomposition approach that
is not based on prediction, but based on the instantaneous phase dependency
between the intrinsic components of a decomposed time series. The method
involves two assumptions: (1) any cause effect relationship can be quantified
with instantaneous phase dependency between the source and target decomposed as
intrinsic components at specific time scale, and (2) the phase dynamics in the
target originating from the source are separable from the target itself. Using
empirical mode decomposition, we show that the causal interaction is encoded in
instantaneous phase dependency at a specific time scale, and this phase
dependency is diminished when the causal-related intrinsic component is removed
from the effect. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generic applicability of our
method to both stochastic and deterministic systems, and show the consistency
of the causal decomposition method compared to existing methods, and finally
uncover the key mode of causal interactions in both the modelled and actual
predator prey system. We anticipate that this novel approach will assist with

for efficient multi-task reinforcement learning. Our framework trains agents to
employ hierarchical policies that decide when to use a previously learned
policy and when to learn a new skill. This enables agents to continually
acquire new skills during different stages of training. Each learned task
corresponds to a human language description. Because agents can only access
previously learned skills through these descriptions, the agent can always
provide a human-interpretable description of its choices. In order to help the
agent learn the complex temporal dependencies necessary for the hierarchical
policy, we provide it with a stochastic temporal grammar that modulates when to
rely on previously learned skills and when to execute new skills. We validate
our approach on Minecraft games designed to explicitly test the ability to
reuse previously learned skills while simultaneously learning new skills.

proteins. We have demonstrated that the probability distribution $P(t)$ for
unidirectional run time $t$ of a cargo can be remarkably described by Levy walk
for $t<\gamma_u^{-1}$ as $P(t)\propto t^{-3/2} e^{-\gamma_u t}$ with $\gamma_u$
being the unbinding rate of a motor protein from microtubule. The mean squared
displacement of a cargo changes from super-diffusive behavior $\langle
X^2\rangle\propto t^2$ for $t<\gamma_u^{-1}$ to normal diffusion $\langle
X^2\rangle\propto t$ for $t>\gamma_u^{-1}$. By considering the correlation
effect in binding of a motor protein to microtubule, we have shown that Levy
walk behavior of $P(t)\propto t^{-{3/2}}$ persists robustly against
correlations only adding an effective cutoff time $\gamma_b/\gamma_c^2$ with
$\gamma_c$ representing the amount of correlations.

extensively studied. In this paper, we associate each content with a utility,

This problem is non-convex in general but we reformulate it as a convex

decentralized algorithms that can be implemented using limited information and
use a discrete time Lyapunov technique (DTLT) to correctly characterize their

hybridization of radiative and evanescent fields. Electron back action appears
as a localized optical field to modify an incident surface-plasmon-polariton
(SPP) evanescent field. This leads to high sensitivity (beyond the diffraction
limit) to local environments and provides a scrutiny tool for molecules or
protein selectively bounded with carbon. A scattering matrix with frequencies
around the surface-plasmon (SP) resonance supports this scrutiny tool and
exhibits sensibly the increase, decrease and even a full suppression of the
polarization field in the vicinity of a conducting surface for longer SPP
wavelengthes. Moreover, triply-hybridized absorption peaks associated with SP,
acoustic- and optical-like graphene plasmons become significant only at high SP
frequencies, but are overshadowed by a round SPP peak for low SP frequencies.
These resonant features (different from 3D photonic lattices) facilitate the
polariton-only excitations, giving rise to possible polariton condensation for
a threshold-free laser. The current graphene-plasmon hybridization formalism
can be easily generalized to other two-dimensional materials, such as silicene,

regards to map storage, the mammalian brain appears to take a diametrically
opposed approach to all current robotic mapping systems. Where robotic mapping
systems attempt to solve the data association problem to minimise
representational aliasing, neurons in the brain intentionally break data
association by encoding large (potentially unlimited) numbers of places with a

scheme that enables storage requirements to grow sub-linearly with the size of
the environment being mapped. To improve robustness in challenging real-world

both multi-exemplar learning and data augmentation techniques. Using large
benchmark robotic mapping datasets, we demonstrate the combined system
achieving high-performance place recognition with sub-linear storage
requirements, and characterize the performance-storage growth trade-off curve.

typically mediated by an energy barrier whose properties determine the
corresponding pathways and rates. The latter is the flux through a dividing
surface (DS) between the two corresponding regions and it is exact only if it
is free of recrossings. For time-independent barriers, the DS can be attached
to the top of the corresponding saddle point of the potential energy surface,
and in time-dependent systems, the DS is a moving object. The precise
determination of reaction rates, eg using transition state theory, requires the
actual construction of a DS for a given saddle geometry which is in general a
demanding methodical and computational task, especially in high-dimensional
systems. In this paper, we demonstrate how such time-dependent, global, and
recrossing-free DSs can be constructed using neural networks. In our approach,
the neural network uses the bath coordinates and time as input and it is
trained in a way that its output provides the position of the DS along the
reaction coordinate. An advantage of this procedure is that, once the neural
network is trained, the complete information about the dynamical phase space
separation is stored in the network's parameters, and a precise distinction
between reactants and products can be made for all possible system

Here, we report the experimental realization of quantum tunneling of a single
particle through different types of potential barriers by performing digital
quantum simulations using IBM quantum computers. We consider two and
three-qubit systems to visualize the tunneling process and illustrate its
unique quantum nature. We observe the tunneling and oscillations of the
particles in a step-well, double-well, and multi-well potentials through our
experimental results. One may extend the proposed quantum circuits and
simulation techniques used here for observing the tunneling phenomena for
multi-particle systems in different potentials.

two image domains, such as colorization, super resolution and conditional image
synthesis. In most of these tasks, an input image may correspond to multiple
outputs. However, current existing approaches only show very minor diversity of
the outputs. In this paper, we present a novel approach to synthesize diverse
realistic images corresponding to a semantic layout. We introduce a diversity
loss objective, which maximizes the distance between synthesized image pairs
and links the input noise to the semantic segments in the synthesized images.
Thus, our approach can not only produce diverse images, but also allow users to
manipulate the output images by adjusting the noise manually. Experimental
results show that images synthesized by our approach are significantly more
diverse than that of the current existing works and equipping our diversity
loss does not degrade the reality of the base networks.

the Taylor number ($\mathrm{Ta}$) are varied in the range $0 < \mathrm{Q},
\mathrm{Ta} \leq 50$. Depending on the values of the parameters in the chosen
range and choice of initial conditions, onset of convection is found be either
periodic or chaotic. Interestingly, it is found that chaos at the onset can
occur through four different routes namely homoclinic, intermittency, period
doubling and quasi-periodic routes. Homoclinic and intermittent routes to chaos
at the onset occur in presence of weak magnetic field ($\mathrm{Q} < 2$), while
period doubling route is observed for relatively stronger magnetic field
($\mathrm{Q} \geq 2$) for one set of initial conditions. On the other hand,
quasiperiodic route to chaos at the onset is observed for another set of
initial conditions. However, the rotation rate (value of $\mathrm{Ta}$) also
plays an important role in determining the nature of convection at the onset.
Analysis of the system simultaneously with DNS and low dimensional modeling
helps to clearly identify different flow regimes concentrated near the onset of
convection and understand their origins. The periodic or chaotic convection at
the onset is found to be connected with rich bifurcation structures involving
subcritical pitchfork, imperfect pitchfork, supercritical Hopf, imperfect
homoclinic gluing and Neimark-Sacker bifurcations.

based on convenient smoothness where only intuitionist models were built. We
isolate a completeness condition, called k-quasi-completeness, and an

information about extreme states of matter. Probing these gravitational
emissions requires the gravitational-wave detectors to have high sensitivity

gap between the quantum-limited sensitivity and the classical noise at high
frequencies. Here we propose a detector design that closes such a gap by
reducing the high-frequency quantum noise with an active optomechanical filter,
frequency-dependent squeezing, and high optical power. The resulting noise
level from 1 kHz to 4 kHz approaches the current facility limit and is a factor
of 20 to 30 below the design of existing advanced detectors. This will allow
for precision measurements of (i) the post-merger signal of the binary neutron

hole-neutron star systems, and possible detection of (iii) high-frequency modes
during supernovae explosions. This design tries to maximize the science return
of current facilities by achieving a sensitive frequency band that is
complementary to the longer-baseline third-generation detectors: the10 km
Einstein Telescope, and 40 km Cosmic Explorer. We have highlighted the main
technical challenges towards realizing the design, which requires dedicated

such enhanced transmission under suppressed reflection turns into the
reflectionless regime, which is similar to that observed in the PT-symmetric

First, we have examined the bulk packing fraction for the Eden cluster and
investigated the effects of the standard deviation and the total number of

the number of particles and the standard deviation. In particular, for the
dependence on the standard deviation, we have determined the asymptotic value
of the bulk packing fraction in the limit of the dimensionless standard
deviation. This value is larger than the packing fraction obtained in a
previous study of the Eden model with uniform-size particles. Secondly, we have
investigated the packing fraction of the entire Eden cluster including the
effect of the interface fluctuation. We find that the entire packing fraction
depends on the number of particles while it is independent of the standard
deviation, in contrast to the bulk packing fraction. In a similar way to the
bulk packing fraction, we have obtained the asymptotic value of the entire
packing fraction in the limit $N_{\mathrm{T}} \to \infty$. The obtained value
of the entire packing fraction is smaller than that of the bulk value. This
fact suggests that the interface fluctuation of the Eden cluster influences the

powered by magnetar spin-down. iPTF16asu is a peculiar broad-lined type Ic
supernova discovered by the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory. With a
rest-frame rise time of only 4 days, iPTF16asu challenges the existing popular
models, for example, the radioactive heating (56Ni-only) and the magnetar+56Ni
models. Here we show that this rapid rise could be attributed to interaction
between the SN ejecta and a pre-existing circumstellar medium ejected by the
progenitor during its final stages of evolution, while the late-time light
curve can be better explained by energy input from a rapidly spinning magnetar.
This model is a natural extension to the previous magnetar model. The mass-loss
rate of the progenitor and ejecta mass are consistent with a progenitor that
experienced a common envelope evolution in a binary. An alternative model for
the early rapid rise of the light curve is the cooling of a shock propagating
into an extended envelope of the progenitor. It is difficult at this stage to
tell which model (interaction+magnetar+56Ni or cooling+magnetar+56Ni) is better
for iPTF16asu. However, it is worth noting that the inferred envelope mass in
the cooling+magnetar+56Ni is very high.

In Theorem 2.4 (Theorem 2.5, respectively) \pfrak_0 is a d-dimensional Gaussian

family, respectively) and $\hat{\pfrak}_n$ is another $d$-dimensional Gaussian
distribution with estimated mean and covariance matrix (another element of the

feature extraction and machine learning to differentiate the phase of
schizophrenia that samples belong to. However, medical research requires the
use of machine learning not only to give more accurate classification results,
but also to give the results that can be applied to pathological studies. The
main purpose of this study is to obtain the weight values as the representation
of influence of each frequency band on the classification of schizophrenia
phases on the basis of a more effective classification method using the LES
feature extraction, and then the weight values are processed and applied to
improve the accuracy of machine learning classification. We propose a method
called weight-voting to obtain the weights of sub-bands features by using
results of classification for voting to fit the actual categories of EEG data,
and using weights for reclassification. Through this method, we can first
obtain the influence of each band in distinguishing three schizophrenia phases,

high correlation between the change of weight of low gamma band and the
difference between HC, CHR and FES. If the features revised according to
weights are used for reclassification, the accuracy of result will be improved

Laplacian acting on a connected discrete graph $\mathsf{G}$. For both operators
we discuss well-posedness of the associated {linear} parabolic problems \[

all elliptic differential operators of order $2N$ for $N>1$, our most
surprising finding is that, after some transient time, the parabolic equations
driven by $-A$ may display Markovian features, depending on the imposed
transmission conditions in the vertices. Analogous results seem to be unknown
in the case of general domains and even bounded intervals. Our analysis is
based on a detailed study of bi-harmonic functions complemented by simple
combinatorial arguments. We elaborate on analogous issues for the discrete
bi-Laplacian; a characterization of complete graphs in terms of the Markovian

process is described by the coefficients of the famous Wold representation.
These coefficients can be obtained by factorizing the spectral density of the

order to obtain consistent estimators of these coefficients. A spectral
density-driven bootstrap for time series is then developed which uses the
entire sequence of estimated MA coefficients together with appropriately
generated pseudo innovations in order to obtain a bootstrap pseudo time series.
It is shown that if the underlying process is linear and if the pseudo
innovations are generated by means of an i.i.d. wild bootstrap which mimics, to
the necessary extent, the moment structure of the true innovations, this
bootstrap proposal asymptotically works for a wide range of statistics. The
relations of the proposed bootstrap procedure to some other bootstrap
procedures, including the autoregressive-sieve bootstrap, are discussed. It is
shown that the latter is a special case of the spectral density-driven
bootstrap, if a parametric autoregressive spectral density estimator is used.
Simulations investigate the performance of the new bootstrap procedure in
finite sample situations. Furthermore, a real-life data example is presented.

factor is obtained. This solution has an interesting form in terms of a double
rapidly converging series that universally includes all the interactions
considered. An important analysis of the condensate stability, in other words
the study of condensate excitations, is also performed in this paper. In the
Gaussian approximation (from the GP functional), a functional describing the
perturbations of the condensate is derived in details. For a probe wave
function in the form of a plane wave, a spectrum of Bogoliubov excitations was
obtained, from which an equation describing the threshold momentum for the
emergence of instability was derived. An important result of this paper is the
dependence of the threshold on the momentum of a stationary condensate. For
completeness of the presentation, the approximating expression in the form of a
rapidly converging series is obtained for the corresponding dependence.

  Reduction and extraction are based on both IRAF standard tasks and our own

possible or alternatively from supernova features. We used the
spectrophotometric SNIa model SALT2 combined with a set of galaxy templates
that model the host-galaxy contamination to assess the type Ia nature of the
candidates.
  We identify 68 new SNeIa with redshift ranging from z=0.207 to z=0.98

composite spectra around maximum light with cuts in color, lightcurve shape
parameter ('stretch'), host-galaxy mass and redshift. We find that high-z SNeIa
are bluer, brighter and have weaker intermediate mass element absorption lines
than their low-z counterparts at a level consistent with what is expected from
selection effects. We also find a flux excess in the range [3000-3400] A for

artificially removed more of the upper order statistics. Building on this

difference between the working and the reference electrode includes practically
all ohmic potential drops occurring in the solution. Moreover, this ohmic drop
can be related to the conductivity of the solution by an analytical expression

transfer is limited by the conduction of current from the bulk solution to the
electrode. In this regime, the current varies linearly with the electrode
potential and the conductivity of the solution can be estimated from the slope
of the voltammogram using Newman's expression. The electrochemical reaction
used for measuring conductivity of solutions of salts is the cathodic reduction
of water and that used for aqueous acids is the cathodic reduction of hydrogen

uranium metal-oxide bilayers. The bilayers consist of $\leq$ 100 nm of
epitaxial $\alpha$-U (grown on a Nb buffer deposited on sapphire) with a
UO$_{2}$ overlayer of thicknesses of between 20 and 80 nm. The oxides were made
either by depositing via reactive magnetron sputtering, or allowing the uranium
metal to oxidise in air at room temperature. The bilayers were exposed to
hydrogen, with sample temperatures between 80 and 200 C, and monitored via
in-situ x-ray diffraction and complimentary experiments conducted using
Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy - Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy
(STEM-EELS). Small partial pressures of H$_{2}$ caused rapid consumption of the
U metal and lead to changes in the intensity and position of the diffraction
peaks from both the UO$_{2}$ overlayers and the U metal. There is an
orientational dependence in the rate of U consumption. From changes in the
lattice parameter we deduce that hydrogen enters both the oxide and metal
layers, contracting the oxide and expanding the metal. The air-grown oxide
overlayers appear to hinder the H$_{2}$-reaction up to a threshold dose, but
then on heating from 80 to 140 C the consumption is more rapid than for the
as-deposited overlayers. STEM-EELS establishes that the U-hydride layer lies at
the oxide-metal interface, and that the initial formation is at defects or
grain boundaries, and involves the formation of amorphous and/or
nanocrystalline UH$_{3}$. This explains why no diffraction peaks from UH$_{3}$
are observed. {\textcopyright British Crown Owned Copyright 2017/AWE}

Focusing on the skeleton of an extrasolar system, i.e., considering only the
two most massive planets, we study the Hamiltonian of the three-body problem
after the reduction of the angular momentum. Such a Hamiltonian is expanded
both in Poincar\'e canonical variables and in the small parameter $D_2$, which
represents the normalised Angular Momentum Deficit. The value of the mutual
inclination is deduced from $D_2$ and, thanks to the use of interval
arithmetic, we are able to consider open sets of initial conditions instead of
single values. Looking at the convergence radius of the Kolmogorov normal form,
we develop a reverse KAM approach in order to estimate the ranges of mutual
inclinations that are compatible with the long-term stability in a KAM sense.
Our method is successfully applied to the extrasolar systems HD 141399, HD

The error of stochastic finite element solutions is usually measured in a root
mean square sense regarding their dependence on the stochastic input
parameters. An orthogonal projection of a snapshot set onto a corresponding POD
basis defines an optimum reduced approximation in terms of a Monte Carlo
discretization of the root mean square error. The errors of a weighted

definition of a formally-grounded, model-based requirements engineering method

hierarchy provided by the SysML/KAOS goal model. This skeleton is then
completed in a second step by the Event-B specification obtained from system
application domain properties that gives rise to the system structure.
Considering that the domain is represented using ontologies through the
SysML/KAOS Domain Model method, is it possible to automatically produce the
structural part of system Event-B models ? This paper proposes a set of generic
rules that translate SysML/KAOS domain ontologies into an Event-B

the Rodin tool using the Event-B method. They are illustrated through a case
study dealing with a landing gear system. Our proposition makes it possible to
automatically obtain, from a representation of the system application domain in

$\chi_=(G)$ is the minimum number of colours required for this. We study the
equitable chromatic number of the dense random graph $G(n,m)$, where $m =
\left\lfloor p {n \choose 2} \right \rfloor $ and $0<p< 0.86$ is constant. It
is a well-known question of Bollob\'as whether for $p=1/2$ there is a function
$f(n) \rightarrow \infty$ so that for any sequence of intervals of length
$f(n)$, the normal chromatic number of $G(n,m)$ lies outside the intervals with
probability at least $1/2$ if $n$ is large enough. Bollob\'as proposes that
this is likely to hold for $f(n) = \log n$. We show that for the
\emph{equitable} chromatic number, the answer to the analogous question is
negative. In fact, there is a subsequence $(n_j)_{j}$ of the integers where
$\chi_=(G(n_j,m_j)) = n/j$ with high probability, i.e., $\chi_=(G(n_j,m_j))$ is
concentrated on exactly one explicitly known value. This constitutes
surprisingly narrow concentration since in this range the equitable chromatic

automaton groups related to freeness and finiteness. In the course of this
study, we also exhibit some connections between the algebraic structure of
automaton (semi)groups and their dynamics on the boundary. First, we show that
it is undecidable to check whether the group generated by a given invertible
automaton has a positive relation, i.e. a relation p = 1 such that p only
contains positive generators. Besides its obvious relation to the freeness of
the group, the absence of positive relations has previously been studied and is
connected to the triviality of some stabilizers of the boundary. We show that
the emptiness of the set of positive relations is equivalent to the dynamical
property that all (directed positive) orbital graphs centered at non-singular
points are acyclic.
  Gillibert showed that the finiteness problem for automaton semigroups is
undecidable. In the second part of the paper, we show that this undecidability
result also holds if the input is restricted to be bi-reversible and invertible
(but, in general, not complete). As an immediate consequence, we obtain that
the finiteness problem for automaton subsemigroups of semigroups generated by
invertible, yet partial automata, so called automaton-inverse semigroups, is
also undecidable.
  Erratum: Contrary to a statement in a previous version of the paper, our
approach does not show that that the freeness problem for automaton semigroups
is undecidable. We discuss this in an erratum at the end of the paper.

of the XMM-Newton slew survey (XMMSL2). Since stars emit only a small fraction
of their total luminosity in the X-ray band, the stellar XMMSL2 sources ought
to have relatively bright optical counterparts. Therefore the stellar
identifications are obtained by an automatic crossmatch of the XMMSL2 catalog
with the first Gaia data release (Gaia DR1), the 2MASS and the Tycho2 catalogs.
The reliability of this procedure is verified by a comparison with the
individually classified Einstein Observatory medium sensitivity survey X-ray
sources and by a crossmatch with the Chandra Source Catalog. We identify 6815
of the 23252 unique XMMSL2 sources to be stellar sources, while 893 sources are
flagged as unreliable. For every counterpart a matching probability is
estimated based upon the distance between the XMMSL2 source and the
counterpart. Given this matching probability the sample is expected to be
reliable to 96.7 % and complete to 96.3 %. The sample contains stars of all
spectral types and luminosity classes, with late-type dwarfs having the largest
share. For many stellar sources the fractional contribution of the X-ray band
to the total energy output is found above the saturation limit of previous
studies ($L_\mathrm{X}/L_\mathrm{bol}=10^{-3}$), because the XMMSL2 sources are
more affected by flares due to their short exposure times of typically 6 s. A
comparison with the ""Second ROSAT all-sky survey (2RXS) source catalog"" shows
that about 25 % of the stellar XMMSL2 sources are previously unknown X-ray
sources. The results of our identification procedure can be accessed via
VizieR.

necessarily hold. In this paper, we propose a new momentum based method
$\textit{ADINE}$, which relaxes the constraint of $m < 1$ and allows the

This is illustrated by determining the chemical ordering of Ag-Au 309-atom
Mackay icosahedral nanoparticles. The energy of the nanoparticles is described
using a cluster expansion model, and a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) approach
is used to find the exact ground state configurations for all stoichiometries.
The chemical ordering varies widely between the different stoichiometries, and
display a rich zoo of structures with non-trivial ordering.

stimulated Raman transitions between terahertz-spaced atomic energy levels.
More specifically, we address the $3d~^2D_{3/2}$ and $3d~^2D_{5/2}$ fine
structure levels of a single trapped $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ion and spectroscopically
resolve the transition frequency to be $\nu_D = 1{,}819{,}599{,}021{,}534 \pm
8$ Hz. The achieved accuracy is nearly a factor of five better than the
previous best Raman spectroscopy, and is currently limited by the stability of
our atomic clock reference. Furthermore, the population dynamics of
frequency-comb-driven Raman transitions can be fully predicted from the
spectral properties of the frequency comb, and Rabi oscillations with a
contrast of 99.3(6)\% and millisecond coherence time has been achieved.
Importantly, the technique can be easily generalized to transitions in the
sub-kHz to tens of THz range and should be applicable for driving, e.g.,
spin-resolved rovibrational transitions in molecules and hyperfine transitions
in highly charged ions.

  Receiver","submitted to Transactions on Communications",,,,"cs.ET eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To communicate at the nanoscale, researchers have proposed molecular
communication as an energy-efficient solution. The drawback to this solution is
that the histogram of the molecules' hitting times, which constitute the
molecular signal at the receiver, has a heavy tail. Reducing the effects of
this heavy tail, inter-symbol interference (ISI), has been the focus of most
prior research. In this paper, a novel way of decreasing the ISI by defining a
counting region on the spherical receiver's surface facing towards the
transmitter node is proposed. The beneficial effect comes from the fact that
the molecules received from the back lobe of the receiver are more likely to be
coming through longer paths that contribute to ISI. In order to justify this
idea, the joint distribution of the arrival molecules with respect to angle and
time is derived. Using this distribution, the channel model function is
approximated for the proposed system, i.e., the partially counting absorbing
spherical receiver. After validating the channel model function, the
characteristics of the molecular signal are investigated and improved
performance is presented. Moreover, the optimal counting region in terms of bit
error rate is found analytically.

adversarial approach for lifelong, incremental domain adaptation which benefits
from unsupervised alignment to a series of intermediate domains which
successively diverge from the labelled source domain. We empirically
demonstrate that our incremental approach improves handling of large appearance

with a direct, single alignment step approach. Furthermore, by approximating
the feature distribution for the source domain with a generative adversarial

potentially large amounts of the related source training data for only a minor

the Gaussian process (GP) regression in the location and scale parameters of
the Student-t probabilistic model. This allows both mean and variance of the
data to vary as a function of covariates with the attractive feature that the
Student-t model has been widely used as a useful tool for robustifying data
analysis. The challenge in the approximate inference for the GP regression with
the Student-t probabilistic model, lies in the analytical intractability of the
posterior distribution and the lack of concavity of the log-likelihood
function. We present the natural gradient adaptation for the estimation process
which primarily relies on the property that the Student-t model naturally has
orthogonal parametrization with respect to the location and scale paramaters.
Due to this particular property of the model, we also introduce an alternative
Laplace approximation by using the Fisher information matrix in place of the
Hessian matrix of the negative log-likelihood function. According to
experiments this alternative approximation provides very similar posterior
approximations and predictive performance when compared to the traditional
Laplace approximation. We also compare both of these Laplace approximations
with the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) method. Moreover, we compare our
heteroscedastic Student-t model and the GP regression with the heteroscedastic
Gaussian model. We also discuss how our approach can improve the inference
algorithm in cases where the probabilistic model assumed for the data is not
log-concave.

be more sensitive to developmental changes could help improve their function
and usability in paediatric populations. Taking advantage of the
multi-dimensional structure of EEG data through tensor analysis offers a
framework to extract relevant developmental features present in paediatric
resting-state EEG datasets. Methods. Three paediatric datasets from varying
developmental states and populations were analyzed using a developed two-step
constrained Parallel Factor (PARAFAC) tensor decomposition. The datasets
included the Muir Maxwell Epilepsy Centre, Children's Hospital Boston-MIT and
the Child Mind Institute, outlining two impaired and one healthy population,
respectively. Within dataset cross-validation used support vector machines
(SVM) for classification of out-of-fold data predicting subject age as a proxy
measure of development. t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE)
maps complemented classification analysis through visualization of the
high-dimensional feature structures. Main Results. Development-sensitive
features were successfully identified for the developmental conditions of each
dataset. SVM classification accuracy and misclassification costs were improved
significantly for both healthy and impaired paediatric populations. t-SNE maps
revealed suitable tensor factorization was key in extracting developmental

achieved via a probabilistic construction that can be derandomized efficiently.

seeking procedure. It has the advantages over the well-known mean shift
algorithm that it is feasible in high-dimensional vector spaces and results in
uniquely, well defined modes. Moreover, without any additional computational
effort it may yield a multi-scale hierarchy of clusterings. The time complexity
is just O(n^1.5). resulting computing times range from seconds for 10^4 objects
to minutes for 10^5 objects and to less than an hour for 10^6 objects. The
space complexity is just O(n). The procedure is well suited for finding large
sets of small clusters and is thereby a candidate to analyze thousands of
clusters in millions of objects.
  The kNN mode seeking procedure can be used for active learning by assigning
the clusters to the class of the modal objects of the clusters. Its feasibility
is shown by some examples with up to 1.5 million handwritten digits. The
obtained classification results based on the clusterings are compared with
those obtained by the nearest neighbor rule and the support vector classifier
based on the same labeled objects for training. It can be concluded that using
the clustering structure for classification can be significantly better than
using the trained classifiers. A drawback of using the clustering for
classification, however, is that no classifier is obtained that may be used for
out-of-sample objects.

bare nuclear force for nuclei in antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD). In
AMD, the short-range correlation is described in terms of large imaginary
centroids of Gaussian wave packets of nucleon pairs in opposite signs, causing
high-momentum components in nucleon pair. We superpose these AMD basis states
and name this method ""high-momentum AMD"" (HM-AMD), which is capable of
describing strong tensor correlation (Prog. Theor. Exp. Phys. (2017) 111D01).
In this paper, we extend HM-AMD by including up to two kinds of nucleon pairs
in each AMD basis state utilizing the cluster expansion, which produces
many-body correlations involving high-momentum components. We investigate how
much HM-AMD describes the short-range correlation by showing the results for
$^3$H using the Argonne V4$^\prime$ central potential. It is found that HM-AMD
reproduces the results of few-body calculations and also the tensor-optimized
AMD. This means that HM-AMD is a powerful approach to describe the short-range
correlation in nuclei. In HM-AMD, momentum directions of nucleon pairs
isotropically contribute to the short-range correlation, which is different
from the tensor correlation.

to network operators. We examine atypical events when a unexpected large

approach based on ray launching simulation and point process theory. This work
is motivated by recent results using large deviations theory applied to the
signal-to-interference ratio. This theory provides a tool for the stochastic
analysis of atypical but disruptive events, particularly when the density of
transmitters is high. For a section of a European city, we introduce a new
stochastic model of a single network cell that uses ray launching data
generated with the open source RaLaNS package, giving deterministic path loss
values. We collect statistics on the fraction of (dis)connected users in the
uplink, and observe that the probability of an unexpected large proportion of
disconnected users decreases exponentially when the transmitter density
increases. This observation implies that denser networks become more stable in
the sense that the probability of the fraction of (dis)connected users
deviating from its mean, is exponentially small. We also empirically obtain and
illustrate the density of users for network configurations in the disruptive
event, which highlights the fact that such bottleneck behaviour not only stems
from too many users at the cell boundary, but also from the near-far effect of
many users in the immediate vicinity of the base station. We discuss the
implications of these findings and outline possible future research directions.

in computer vision, and remarkable progress has been attained by localizing
semantic-aware image regions and predicting their labels with deep
convolutional neural networks. The step of hypothesis regions (region
proposals) localization in these existing multi-label image recognition
pipelines, however, usually takes redundant computation cost, e.g., generating
hundreds of meaningless proposals with non-discriminative information and
extracting their features, and the spatial contextual dependency modeling among
the localized regions are often ignored or over-simplified. To resolve these
issues, this paper proposes a recurrent attention reinforcement learning
framework to iteratively discover a sequence of attentional and informative
regions that are related to different semantic objects and further predict
label scores conditioned on these regions. Besides, our method explicitly
models long-term dependencies among these attentional regions that help to
capture semantic label co-occurrence and thus facilitate multi-label
recognition. Extensive experiments and comparisons on two large-scale

by introducing our algorithm for constructing bounding perimeters around
subsets of a two dimensional field, and reviewing the definition of Minkowski
Tensors. Focusing on the translational invariant statistic $W^{1,1}_{2}$ - a $2
\times 2$ matrix - we calculate its eigenvalues for both the entire excursion
set ($\Lambda_{1},\Lambda_{2}$) and for individual connected regions and holes
within the set ($\lambda_{1},\lambda_{2}$). The ratio of eigenvalues
$\Lambda_{2}/\Lambda_{1}$ informs us of the presence of global anisotropies in
the data, and $\langle \lambda_{2}/\lambda_{1} \rangle$ is a measure of the
mean shape of peaks and troughs in the density field. We study these quantities
for a Gaussian field, then consider how they are modified by the effect of
gravitational collapse using the latest Horizon Run 4 cosmological simulation.
We find $\Lambda_{1,2}$ are essentially independent of gravitational collapse,
as the process maintains statistical isotropy. However, the mean shape of peaks
is modified significantly - overdensities become relatively more circular
compared to underdensities of the same area. When applying the statistic to a
redshift space distorted density field, we find a significant signal in the

how to use Ziegler's theorem to show that the consequence relations for the

the interplay between the asymptotic freedom of QCD and the Fourier transform

miscibility, where miscible components lead to a mixed ground state and

separated in situ by a large gravitational sag. An analysis of the center of
mass positions of the BECs after expansion yields qualitative agreement with
the homogeneous criterion for phase-separation, but reveals no clear transition
point between the mixed and the separated phases. Instead one can identify a
transition region, for which the presence of a gravitational sag is found to be
advantageous. Moreover we analyze the situation where only one component is

typical approach of depth integrating the Navier-Stokes equations along the

bottom. We claim that an integration path that better adapts to the shallow
water hypotheses follows the ""cross-flow"" surface, i.e., a surface that is
normal to the velocity field at any point of the domain. Because of the
implicitness of this definition, we approximate this ""cross-flow"" path by
performing depth integration along a local direction normal to the bottom
surface, and propose a rigorous derivation of this approximation and its
numerical solution as an essential step for the future development of the full
""cross-flow"" integration procedure. We start by defining a local coordinate
system, anchored on the bottom surface to derive a covariant form of the
Navier-Stokes equations. Depth integration along the local normals yields a
covariant version of the shallow water equations, which is characterized by
flux functions and source terms that vary in space because of the surface
metric coefficients and related derivatives. The proposed model is discretized
with a first order FORCE-type Godunov Finite Volume scheme that allows
implementation of spatially variable fluxes. We investigate the validity of our
SW model and the effects of the bottom geometry by means of three synthetic
test cases that exhibit non negligible slopes and surface curvatures. The
results show the importance of taking into consideration bottom geometry even

(e.g., image details or noises), respectively, and enable reconstructing the
original input image through the decoding process. Then, we feed the
low-frequency channel into a standard classification network such as VGG or
ResNet and employ a very lightweight network to fuse with the high-frequency
channel to obtain the classification result. Compared to existing DNN
acceleration solutions, our framework has the following advantages: i) it is
tolerant to any existing convolutional neural networks for classification
without amending their structures; ii) the WAE provides an interpretable way to
preserve the main components of the input image for classification.

is possible to construct more than one invariant in the Yukawa sector. In such
models, the Yukawa couplings of the 125 GeV Higgs boson undergo nontrivial
modifications. The pattern of such modifications can be encoded in a generic
phenomenological Lagrangian which applies to a wide class of such models. We
show that the presence of more than one Yukawa invariant allows the gauge and
Yukawa coupling modifiers to be decorrelated in the 'extended' models, and this
decorrelation leads to a relaxation of the bound on the compositeness scale (f
> 640 GeV at 95% CL, as compared to f > 1 TeV for the minimal 5L-5R

fermion-embedding up to representations of dimension 20. While quantifying our

possible, infrared beaming parameters. We obtained a total of 8097 diameters
and albedos for 5170 asteroids, and we fitted the beaming parameter for almost
two thousand of them. When it was not possible to fit the beaming parameter, we
used a straight line fit to our sample's beaming parameter-versus-phase angle
plot to set the default value for each fit individually instead of using a
single average value. Our diameters agree with stellar-occultation-based
diameters well within the accuracy expected for the model. They also match the
previous AKARI-based catalogue at phase angles lower than 50 degrees, but we
find a systematic deviation at higher phase angles, at which near-Earth and
Mars-crossing asteroids were observed. The AKARI IRC All-sky survey provides
observations at different observation geometries, rotational coverages and

elongated objects even based on an idealised model like the NEATM.

Marscher et al. 2010) strongly suggests that a fraction of the blazar flares
seen by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) take place a few to several pc
away from the central engine. However, at such distances from the central
engine, there is no adequate external photon field to provide the seed photons
required for producing the observed GeV emission under leptonic inverse Compton
(IC) models. A possible solution is a spine-sheath geometry for the emitting
region (MacDonald et al. 2015, but see Nalewajko et al. 2014). Here we use the
current view of the molecular torus (e.g., Elitzur, 2012; Netzer 2015) in which
the torus extends a few pc beyond the dust sublimation radius with dust clouds
distributed with a declining density for decreasing polar angle. We show that
for a spine-sheath blazar jet embedded in the torus, the wide beaming pattern
of the synchrotron radiation of the relatively slow sheath will heat molecular
clouds whose subsequent IR radiation will be seen highly boosted in the spine
comoving frame, and that under reasonable conditions this photon field can
dominate over the sheath photons directly entering the spine. If the sheath is
sufficiently luminous it will sublimate the dust, and if the sheath synchrotron
radiation extends to optical-UV energies (as may happen during flares), this
will illuminate the sublimated dust clouds to produce emission lines that will
vary in unison with the optical-UV continuum, as has been very recently
reported for blazar CTA 102 (Jorstad et al. 2017).

the theoretical as well as from the experimental perspective. Usually they are
motivated as pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons. In this case one of their most
important features is that their coupling to other particles is suppressed by a
large scale, the vacuum expectation value of the field breaking the symmetry
that gives rise to them. This naturally endows them with very weak interactions
but also restricts the maximal field value and therefore the regions where
sufficient dark matter is produced. In this paper we investigate deviations
from this simplest setup, where the potential and interactions are as expected
for a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson, but the kinetic term has singularities.
This leads to a significantly increased area in parameter space where such
particles can be dark matter and can be probed by current and near future
experiments. We discuss cosmological limits and in the course of this give a
simple derivation of a formula for isocurvature fluctuations in models with
general anharmonic potentials. As an application of this formula we give an
update of the isocurvature constraints for QCD axion dark matter models, using

to five Pa, when scaled to a metre length). The presence of eroded material at
the base of most overhangs, as well as the observed collapse of two features
and implied previous collapse of another, suggests that they are prone to
failure and that true material strengths are close to these lower limits
(although we only consider static stresses and not dynamic stress from, for
example, cometary activity). Thus, a tensile strength of a few pascals is a
good approximation for the tensile strength of 67P's nucleus material, which is
in agreement with previous work. We find no particular trends in overhang
properties with size, over the $\sim10-100$ m range studied here, or location
on the nucleus. There are no obvious differences, in terms of strength, height
or evidence of collapse, between the populations of overhangs on the two

branching and linear-time semantics, in a coalgebraic setting. Given a
coalgebra $\alpha\colon X \to HX$ for a functor $H \colon \mathrm{Set}\to
\mathrm{Set}$, we define a framework for deriving pseudometrics on $X$ which
measure the behavioral distance of states.
  A crucial step is the lifting of the functor $H$ on $\mathrm{Set}$ to a
functor $\overline{H}$ on the category $\mathrm{PMet}$ of pseudometric spaces.
We present two different approaches which can be viewed as generalizations of
the Kantorovich and Wasserstein pseudometrics for probability measures. We show
that the pseudometrics provided by the two approaches coincide on several
natural examples, but in general they differ.
  If $H$ has a final coalgebra, every lifting $\overline{H}$ yields in a
canonical way a behavioral distance which is usually branching-time, i.e., it
generalizes bisimilarity. In order to model linear-time metrics (generalizing
trace equivalences), we show sufficient conditions for lifting distributive
laws and monads. These results enable us to employ the generalized powerset
construction.

introducing the moment-adjusted stochastic gradient descents, a new stochastic

theory that characterizes the statistical distribution for certain iterative
methods with optimization guarantees. On the statistical front, the theory
allows for model mis-specification, with very mild conditions on the data. For
optimization, the theory is flexible for both convex and non-convex cases.
Remarkably, the moment-adjusting idea motivated from ""error standardization"" in
statistics achieves a similar effect as acceleration in first-order
optimization methods used to fit generalized linear models. We also demonstrate
this acceleration effect in the non-convex setting through numerical

phenomena up to geological scales, to industrial and technological
applications, where they represent the only way to control and promote mixing
at low Reynolds numbers, well below the transition from laminar to turbulent
flow. As for immiscible fluids, the onset of hydrodynamic instabilities in
miscible fluids is directly related to the physics of their interfaces. The
focus of this review is therefore on the general mechanisms driving the growth
of disturbances at the boundary between miscible fluids, under a variety of
forcing conditions. In the absence of a regularizing mechanism, these
disturbances would grow indefinitely. For immiscible fluids, interfacial
tension provides such a regularizing mechanism, because of the energy cost
associated to the creation of new interface by a growing disturbance. For
miscible fluids, however, the very existence of interfacial stresses that mimic
an effective surface tension is debated. Other mechanisms, however, may also be
relevant, such as viscous dissipation. We shall review the stabilizing
mechanisms that control the most common hydrodynamic instabilities,
highlighting those cases for which the lack of an effective interfacial tension
poses deep conceptual problems in the mathematical formulation of a linear
stability analysis. Finally, we provide a short overview on the ongoing
research on the effective, out of equilibrium interfacial tension between
miscible fluids.

$\xi/\lambda_{F}\approx2\cdots4$. These values make fluctuations of the
superconducting order parameter increasingly important, to the extend that the

proposal of an odd-parity pairing state. This begs the question of the nature
of the transition in an unconventional superconductor with strong pairing
fluctuations. We show that for a multi-component order parameter, these
fluctuations give rise to a nematic phase at $T_{{\rm nem}}>T_{c}$. Below
$T_{c}$ several experiments demonstrated a rotational symmetry breaking where
the Cooper pair wave function is locked to the lattice. Our theory shows that
this rotational symmetry breaking, as vestige of the superconducting state,
already occurs above $T_{c}$. The nematic phase is characterized by vanishing
off-diagonal long range order, yet with anisotropic superconducting
fluctuations. It can be identified through direction-dependent
para-conductivity, lattice softening, and an enhanced Raman response in the

Sobolev spaces valued in metric spaces. We study harmonic mappings, i.e.
minimizers of the Dirichlet energy provided that the values on the boundary d

the theory of Koorevaar, Schoen and Jost and we use instead arguments based on
optimal transport. We manage to get existence of harmonic mappings provided
that the boundary values are Lipschitz on d Omega, uniqueness is an open
question. If Omega is a segment of R, it is known that a curve valued in the
Wasserstein space P(D) can be seen as a superposition of curves valued in D. We
show that it is no longer the case in higher dimensions: a generic mapping
Omega -> P(D) cannot be represented as the superposition of mappings Omega ->
D. We are able to show the validity of a maximum principle: the composition
F(mu) of a function F : P(D) -> R convex along generalized geodesics and a
harmonic mapping mu : Omega -> P(D) is a subharmonic real-valued function. We
also study the special case where we restrict ourselves to a given family of
elliptically contoured distributions (a finite-dimensional and geodesically
convex submanifold of (P(D), W\_2) which generalizes the case of Gaussian
measures) and show that it boils down to harmonic mappings valued in the
Riemannian manifold of symmetric matrices endowed with the distance coming from

from the halo-matter-matter-matter trispectrum. We measure this statistic
efficiently by cross-correlating the halo field measured in N-body simulations
with specific third-order nonlocal transformations of the initial density field
in the same simulation. Together with the recent Abidi & Baldauf (2018), these
are the first measurements of halo bias using the four-point function that have
been reported to date. We also obtain constraints on the quadratic bias
parameters. For all individual cubic parameters involving the tidal field
$\mathcal{K}_{ij}$, we find broad consistency with the prediction of the
Lagrangian local-in-matter-density ansatz, with some indications of a positive
Lagrangian coefficient $b_{\rm td}^L$ multiplying the time derivative of
$\mathcal{K}_{ij}$. For the quadratic tidal bias ($b_{K^2}$), we obtain a
significant detection of a negative Lagrangian tidal bias.

aqueous colloidal solution of dextran-coated magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles.
Data analysis with the formalism based on Gilbert-Landau-Lifshitz equation for
stochastic dynamics of superparamagnetic (SP) particles ensured extensive
quantifying of the system via a set of magnetic and magnetodynamic parameters,
such as the mean magnetic moment, the damping constant, the longitudinal
relaxation time, the magnetic anisotropy field and energy, and others. Combined
with transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering, M2
technique allowed obtaining additional parameters, viz., the dextran-coating
thickness and the interparticle magnetic dipolar energy. Aggregated colloidal
nanoparticles were shown to be magnetically correlated inside the aggregate due
to magnetic dipole-dipole (d-d) coupling within the correlation radius ~50 nm.
With the d-d coupling account, the volume distribution of the aggregates
recovered from M2 measurements is well consistent with electron microscopy
results. From electron magnetic resonance, abrupt change of SP dynamics with
increasing external magnetic field was observed and explained. The presented
study exemplifies a novel M2-based procedure of comprehensive quantitative

projected 1.9 kpc from the nucleus of M87. The combination of the sensitivity
of COS and the proximity of M87 allows us to study the structure of this
filament in unparalleled detail. We propose that the filament is composed of
many cold clumps, each surrounded by an FUV-emitting boundary layer, with the
filament having a radius $r_c \sim 10$ pc and the clumps filling the cylinder
with a low volume filling factor. The observed velocity dispersion in emission
lines from the filament results from the random motions of these clumps within
the filament.
  We measure fluxes and kinematics for emission lines of Ly$\alpha$, C II
$\lambda$1335, and N V $\lambda1238$. We associate these three lines, as well
as archival measurements of H$\alpha$, C IV $\lambda$1549, and He II
$\lambda$1640, with a multitemperature boundary layer around clumps which are
moving with supersonic random motions in the filament. This boundary layer is a
significant coolant of the hot gas. We show that the [C II] $\lambda$158$\mu$m
flux observed by Herschel-PACS from this region implies the existence of a
massive cold ($T \sim 10^3$ K) component in the filament which contains
significantly more mass than the FUV-emitting boundary layer.
  We also detect [Fe XXI] $\lambda$1354 in emission at $4-5\sigma$. This line
is emitted from 1 keV ($T \approx 10^7$ K) plasma, and we use it to measure the
bulk radial velocity and velocity dispersion of the plasma at this temperature.
In contrast to the intermediate-temperature FUV lines, [\ion{Fe}{xxi}] is
blueshifted relative to M87 and matches the bulk velocity of a nearby filament
to the south. We hypothesize that this line arises from the approaching face of
the radio bubble expanding through this sightline, while the filament lies on
the receding side of the bubble. (abstract is abridged)

spin-orbit coupling profile, we investigate the equilibrium properties of the
spin sector when a uniform magnetic field is applied along the nanowire axis.
We find that the interplay between magnetic field and Rashba coupling generates
a spin current, polarised perpendicularly to the applied field and flowing
through the nanowire even at equilibrium. In the nanowire bulk such effect
persists far beyond the regime where the nanowire mimics the helical states of
a quantum spin Hall system, while in the leads the spin current is suppressed.
Furthermore, despite the nanowire not being proximized by superconductors, at
the interfaces with the leads we predict the appearance of localized spin
torques and spin polarizations, orthogonal to the magnetic field and partially
penetrating into the leads. This feature, due to the inhomogeneity of the
Rashba coupling, suggests to use caution in interpreting spin polarization as
signatures of Majorana fermions. When the magnetic field has a component also
along the Rashba field, its collinearity with the spin polarization and
orthogonality to the spin current are violated in the nanowire bulk too. We
analyze these quantities in terms of the magnetic field and chemical potential
for both long and short nanowires in experimentally realistic regimes.

tool to study a variety of astrophysical systems such as neutron star mergers,

GRMHD scheme numerically evolves a set of conservation equations for
'conserved' quantities and requires the computation of certain primitive
variables at every time step. This recovery procedure constitutes a core part
of any conservative GRMHD scheme and it is closely tied to the equation of
state (EOS) of the fluid. In the quest to include nuclear physics, weak
interactions, and neutrino physics, state-of-the-art GRMHD simulations employ
finite-temperature, composition-dependent EOSs. While different schemes have
individually been proposed, the recovery problem still remains a major source
of error, failure, and inefficiency in GRMHD simulations with advanced
microphysics. The strengths and weaknesses of the different schemes when
compared to each other remain unclear. Here we present the first systematic
comparison of various recovery schemes used in different dynamical spacetime
GRMHD codes for both analytic and tabulated microphysical EOSs. We assess the
schemes in terms of (i) speed, (ii) accuracy, and (iii) robustness. We find
large variations among the different schemes and that there is not a single
ideal scheme. While the computationally most efficient schemes are less robust,
the most robust schemes are computationally less efficient. More robust schemes
may require an order of magnitude more calls to the EOS, which are
computationally expensive. We propose an optimal strategy of an efficient
three-dimensional Newton-Raphson scheme and a slower but more robust
one-dimensional scheme as a fall-back.

controlled by the temperature structure in the protoplanetary disk and dynamics
and migration of planetesimals and planetary embryos. This results in the
formation of planetesimals and planetary embryos with a great variety of
compositions, water contents and degrees of oxidation. The internal evolution
and especially the formation time of planetesimals relative to the timescale of
radiogenic heating by short-lived 26Al decay may govern the amount of hydrous
silicates and leftover rock-ice mixtures available in the late stages of their
evolution. In turn, water content may affect the early internal evolution of
the planetesimals and in particular metal-silicate separation processes.
Moreover, water content may contribute to an increase of oxygen fugacity and
thus affect the concentrations of siderophile elements within the silicate
reservoirs of Solar System objects. Finally, the water content strongly
influences the differentiation rate of the icy moons, controls their internal
evolution and governs the alteration processes occurring in their deep
interiors.

statistical power in the combined map primarily from the SPT data. We fit the
corresponding lensing angular power spectrum to a model including cold dark
matter and a cosmological constant ($\Lambda$CDM), and to models with
single-parameter extensions to $\Lambda$CDM. We find constraints that are
comparable to and consistent with constraints found using the full-sky Planck
CMB lensing data. Specifically, we find $\sigma_8 \Omega_{\rm m}^{0.25}=0.598
\pm 0.024$ from the lensing data alone with relatively weak priors placed on
the other $\Lambda$CDM parameters. In combination with primary CMB data from
Planck, we explore single-parameter extensions to the $\Lambda$CDM model. We
find $\Omega_k = -0.012^{+0.021}_{-0.023}$ or $M_{\nu}< 0.70$eV both at 95%
confidence, all in good agreement with results that include the lensing
potential as measured by Planck over the full sky. We include two independent
free parameters that scale the effect of lensing on the CMB: $A_{L}$, which
scales the lensing power spectrum in both the lens reconstruction power and in
the smearing of the acoustic peaks, and $A^{\phi \phi}$, which scales only the
amplitude of the CMB lensing reconstruction power spectrum. We find $A^{\phi

relaying networks is proposed to mitigate error propagation effects and improve
system spectral efficiency. The idea is to allow the FD relay node to predict
the correctly decoded symbols of each frame, based on the generalized square
deviation method, and discard the erroneously decoded symbols, resulting in
fewer errors being forwarded to the destination node. Using the capability for
simultaneous transmission and reception at the FD relay node, our proposed
strategy can improve the transmission efficiency without extra cost of
signalling overhead. In addition, targeting on the derived expression for
outage probability, we compare it with half-duplex (HD) relaying case, and
provide the transmission power and relay location optimization strategy to
further enhance system performance. The results show that our proposed scheme
outperforms the classic relaying protocols, such as cyclic redundancy check
based selective decode-and-forward (S-DF) relaying and threshold based S-DF
relaying in terms of outage probability and bit-error-rate. Moreover, the
performances with optimal power allocation is better than that with equal power
allocation, especially when the FD relay node encounters strong
self-interference and/or it is close to the destination node.

mechanisms, our approach does not use the hidden RNN state as input to the
attention model. Instead, attention distributions are extracted using external

aspects of explanability, as the spatial and temporal attention distributions

size. The smaller the gaps, the more frequently they appear. Additionally, the
sequence of zeroes, despite being non-consecutive numbers, contains a number of
primes approximately equal to n/log(n) , being n the number of terms in the
sequence.

potentials for meeting applicational demands in recent years. As one avenue,
several approaches for fablicating 3D porous graphene network structures have
been developed to realize multi-functional graphene materials with 2D graphene.
Here we overview characteristics of 3D porous graphene for future electronic
device applications along with physical insights into ""2D to 3D graphene"",
where the characters of 2D graphene such as massless Dirac fermions are well
preserved. The present review thus summarizes recent 3D porous graphene studies
with a perspective for providing new and board graphene electronic device
applications.

non-stationary dynamics can present an intermittent behaviour between relative
tranquility and burst of activity whose consequences are often catastrophic. To
understand and ultimately be able to predict such dynamics, we propose an
underlying mechanism based on sharp thresholds of a local generalized energy
density that naturally leads to negative feedback. We find a transition from a
continuous regime to an intermittent one, in which avalanches can be predicted
despite the stochastic nature of the process. This model may have applications
in many natural and social complex systems where a rapid depletion of resources
or generalized energy drives the dynamics. In particular, we show how this
model accurately describes the time evolution and avalanches present in a real
social system.

processes in heterogeneous porous media with varying media coefficients that
include fluid flow and structure interactions is of fundamental importance in
energy, environmental, petroleum and biomedical engineering applications fields
for instance. Important applications include subsurface compaction drive,
carbon sequestration, hydraulic and thermal fracturing and oil recovery.
Biomedical applications include the simulation of vibration therapy for
osteoporosis processes of trabeculae bones, estimating stress levels induced by
tumour growth within the brain or next-generation spinal disc prostheses.
  Variational space-time methods offers some appreciable advantages such as the
flexibility of the triangulation for complex geometries in space and natural
local time stepping, the straightforward construction of higher-order
approximations and the application of efficient goal-oriented (duality-based)
adaptivity concepts. In addition to that, uniform space-time variational
methods appear to be advantageous for stability and a priori error analyses of
the discrete schemes. Especially (high-order) discontinuous in time approaches
appear to have favourable properties due to the weak application of the initial
conditions.
  The development of monolithic multi-physics schemes, instead of iterative
coupling methods between the physical problems, is a key component of the
research to reduce the modeling error. Special emphasis is on the development
of efficient multi-physics and multigrid preconditioning technologies and their
implementation.
  The simulation software DTM++ is a modularised framework written in C++11 and
builds on top of deal.II toolchains. The implementation allows parallel
simulations from notebooks up to cluster scale.
