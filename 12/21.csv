and worldsheets. The exact reformulation is carried out using the recently
developed abelian color flux method where the action is decomposed into
commuting minimal terms that connect different colors on neighboring sites.
Expanding the Boltzmann factors for these commuting terms allows one to
reorganize the gauge field contributions according to links such that the gauge
fields can be integrated out in closed form. The emerging constraints give the
dual variables the structure of worldlines for the fermions and worldsheets for
the gauge degrees of freedom. The partition sum has the form of a strong
coupling expansion and with the abelian color flux approach discussed here all
coefficients of the expansion are known in closed form. We present the dual
form for three cases: pure SU(3) lattice gauge theory, strong coupling QCD and
full QCD, and discuss in detail the constraints for the color fluxes and their
physical interpretation.

elements in the Galaxy could be responsible for a significant fraction of the
solar composition of Kr, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, and Mo ranging from $2$ to $45\%$
depending on the element, the enrichment history of the Galactic gas, and the
total mass ejected per RAWD. This contribution could explain the missing solar
Lighter Element Primary Process for some elements (e.g., Sr, Y, and Zr). We do
not overproduce any isotope relative to the solar composition, but $^{96}$Zr is
produced in a similar amount. The $i$ process produces efficiently the Mo

uncertainties are combined with our GCE uncertainties, the upper limits for the

investigate the important class of local operations assisted by classical

various entanglement properties of n-mode n-partite GFS we investigate the
richer class of Gaussian stochastic LOCC. We characterize Gaussian SLOCC

propagation from the size of the network to a factor of average shortest path
length. The routing mechanism is built upon a specific type of consensus

distributed quantum computing, enhanced sensing and fundamental tests of
quantum mechanics through the distribution of entanglement across nodes. Moving
beyond current two-node networks requires the rate of entanglement generation
between nodes to exceed their decoherence rates. Beyond this critical
threshold, intrinsically probabilistic entangling protocols can be subsumed
into a powerful building block that deterministically provides remote entangled
links at pre-specified times. Here we surpass this threshold using diamond spin
qubit nodes separated by 2 metres. We realise a fully heralded single-photon
entanglement protocol that achieves entangling rates up to 39 Hz, three orders
of magnitude higher than previously demonstrated two-photon protocols on this
platform. At the same time, we suppress the decoherence rate of remote
entangled states to 5 Hz by dynamical decoupling. By combining these results
with efficient charge-state control and mitigation of spectral diffusion, we
are able to deterministically deliver a fresh remote state with average

study of modern networks ranging from social networks, economic networks, to
biological networks. They seek to capture a wide variety of common network
tendencies such as connectivity and reciprocity through local graph properties.
Sampling from these exponential distributions is crucial for parameter
estimation, hypothesis testing, as well as understanding the features of the
network in question. We inspect the efficiency of a popular sampling technique,
the Glauber dynamics, for vertex-weighted exponential random graphs. Letting
$n$ be the number of vertices in the graph, we identify a region in the
parameter space where the mixing time for the Glauber dynamics is $\Theta(n
\log n)$ (the high temperature phase) and a complement region where the mixing
time is exponentially slow on the order of $e^{\Omega(n)}$ (the low temperature
phase). Lastly, we give evidence that along a critical curve in the parameter

quantum metrology. The latter represents one of the most relevant applications
of quantum theory, potentially enabling the capability of measuring unknown
physical parameters with improved precision over classical strategies. Within
this context, most theoretical and experimental studies have focused on
determining the fundamental bounds and how to achieve them in the asymptotic
regime where a large number of resources is employed. However, in most
applications it is necessary to achieve optimal precisions by performing only a
limited number of measurements. To this end, machine learning techniques can be
applied as a powerful optimization tool. Here, we implement experimentally
single-photon adaptive phase estimation protocols enhanced by machine learning,
showing the capability of reaching optimal precision after a small number of
trials. In particular, we introduce a new approach for Bayesian estimation that
exhibit best performances for very low number of photons N. Furthermore, we
study the resilience to noise of the tested methods, showing that the optimized
Bayesian approach is very robust in the presence of imperfections. Application
of this methodology can be envisaged in the more general multiparameter case,
that represents a paradigmatic scenario for several tasks including imaging or

between two independent nonperfect cavities consisting of an atom with finite

interacts with a quantized electromagnetic field in the presence of detuning

therefore, no entanglement exists between them. We use the Bell state
measurement performing on the photons leaving the cavities to swap the
entanglement stored between the atom-fields in each cavity into atom-atom. Our
motivation is arisen from the fact that two-qubit entangled states are of
enough interest for quantum information science and technologies. We discuss
the effect of initial state of the system, detuning parameter, the Kerr medium
and the two dissipation sources on the swapped entanglement to atom-atom. We
interestingly find that when the atomic decay rates and photonic leakages from
the cavities are equal, our system behaves as an ideal system with no

cellular system performance dramatically. Meanwhile, it however involves
significant additional radio-frequency (RF) front-end complexity, hardware cost
and power consumption. To address this issue, the
beamspace-multiple-input-multiple-output (beamspace-MIMO) based approach is
considered as a promising solution. In this paper, we first show that the
traditional beamspace-MIMO suffers from spatial power leakage and imperfect
channel statistics estimation. A beam combination module is hence proposed,
which consists of a small number (compared with the number of antenna elements)
of low-resolution (possibly one-bit) digital (discrete) phase shifters after
the beamspace transformation to further compress the beamspace signal
dimensionality, such that the number of RF chains can be reduced beyond
beamspace transformation and beam selection. The optimum discrete beam
combination weights for the uplink are obtained based on the branch-and-bound
(BB) approach. The key to the BB-based solution is to solve the embodied
sub-problem, whose solution is derived in a closed-form. Based on the solution,
a sequential greedy beam combination scheme with linear-complexity (w.r.t. the
number of beams in the beamspace) is proposed. Link-level simulation results
based on realistic channel models and long-term-evolution (LTE) parameters are
presented which show that the proposed schemes can reduce the number of RF
chains by up to $25\%$ with a one-bit digital phase-shifter-network.

spiral galaxy M33 (the Triangulum) for PNe to gain new insights into the
extended stellar substructure on the northern side of the disc and to study the
existence of a faint classical halo. Methods: The search is based on wide field
imaging covering a 4.5 square degree area out to a maximum projected distance
of about 40 kpc from the centre of the galaxy. The PN candidates are detected
by the combination of images obtained in narrowband filters selecting the
[OIII]$\lambda5007\AA$ and H$\alpha$ + [NII] nebular lines and in the continuum
g' and r' broadband filters. Results:Inside the bright optical disc of M33,

confirmed. No PN candidates were found outside the limits of the disc. Fourteen
additional sources showing [OIII] excess were also discovered. Conclusions:The
absence of bright PN candidates in the area outside the galaxy disc covered by

Atlantic, which would give a de-stabilizing feedback to the Arctic ice cover,
leading to a slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation.

a smooth function versus frequency in the microwave domain, and its effective
dissipation can be continuously monitored by recording the emitted radiation in

direct and inverse Fourier transforms on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ or by using the
direct Fourier transform on $S(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and the inverse one on
$S'(\mathbb{R}^n)$. In the former case, one assumes that the Fourier
multipliers belong to $L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$, while in the latter one this
requirement may or may not be included in the definition. We provide sufficient
conditions for those definitions to coincide as well as examples when they
differ. In particular, we prove that if a Banach function space
$X(\mathbb{R}^n)$ satisfies a certain weak doubling property, then the space of
all Fourier multipliers $\mathcal{M}_{X(\mathbb{R}^n)}$ is continuously
embedded into $L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$ with the best possible embedding
constant one. For weighted Lebesgue spaces $L^p(\mathbb{R}^n,w)$, the weak
doubling property is much weaker than the requirement that $w$ is a Muckenhoupt
weight, and our result implies that
$\|a\|_{L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)}\le\|a\|_{\mathcal{M}_{L^p(\mathbb{R}^n,w)}}$
for such weights. This inequality extends the inequality for $n=1$ from
\cite[Theorem~2.3]{BG98}, where it is attributed to J.~Bourgain. We show that
although the weak doubling property is not necessary, it is quite sharp. It
allows the weight $w$ in $L^p(\mathbb{R}^n,w)$ to grow at any subexponential
rate. On the other hand, the space $L^p(\mathbb{R},e^x)$ has plenty of
unbounded Fourier multipliers.

Their simulation efficiency is generally constrained by the EMT simulation.
With an increasing number of distributed energy resources and non-conventional
loads being installed in distribution systems, it is imperative to extend the
hybrid simulation application to include distribution systems and integrated
transmission and distribution systems. Meanwhile, it is equally important to
improve the simulation efficiency as the modeling scope and complexity of the
detailed system in the EMT simulation increases. To meet both requirements,
this paper introduces an advanced EMT and phasor-domain hybrid simulation
approach. This approach has two main features: 1) a comprehensive phasor-domain
modeling framework which supports positive-sequence, three-sequence,
three-phase and mixed three-sequence/three-phase representations and 2) a
robust and flexible simulation mode switching scheme. The developed scheme
enables simulation switching from hybrid simulation mode back to pure
phasor-domain dynamic simulation mode to achieve significantly improved
simulation efficiency. The proposed method has been tested on integrated
transmission and distribution systems. The results show that with the developed
simulation switching feature, the total computational time is significantly
reduced compared to running the hybrid simulation for the whole simulation

glacial-interglacial cycles that occurred roughly 1 Myr ago, is often
considered as a change in internal climate dynamics. Here we revisit the model
of Quaternary climate dynamics that was proposed by Saltzman and Maasch (1988).
We show that it is quantitatively similar to a scalar equation for the ice
dynamics only when combining the remaining components into a single delayed
feedback term. The delay is the sum of the internal times scales of ocean
transport and ice sheet dynamics, which is on the order of 10 kyr. We find
that, in the absence of astronomical forcing, the delayed feedback leads to
bistable behaviour, where stable large-amplitude oscillations of ice volume and
an equilibrium coexist over a large range of values for the delay. We then
apply astronomical forcing. We perform a systematic study to show how the
system response depends on the forcing amplitude. We find that over a wide
range of forcing amplitudes the forcing leads to a switch from small-scale
oscillations of 41 kyr to large-amplitude oscillations of roughly 100 kyr
without any change of other parameters. The transition in the forced model
consistently occurs near the time of the Mid-Pleistocene Transition as observed
in data records. This provides evidence that the MPT could have been primarily
a forcing-induced switch between attractors of the internal dynamics. Small
additional random disturbances make the forcing-induced transition near 800 kyr
BP even more robust. We also find that the forced system forgets its initial
history during the small-scale oscillations, in particular, nearby initial
conditions converge prior to transitioning. In contrast to this, in the regime
of large-amplitude oscillations, the oscillation phase is very sensitive to
random perturbations, which has a strong effect on the timing of the
deglaciation events.

in stellar physics. Our deficient knowledge of this crucial physical process
introduces a fairly large uncertainty concerning the internal structure and
evolution of stars. A striking example is overshoot at the edge of convective
cores. Indeed, nearly all stellar evolutionary codes treat the overshooting
zones in a very approximative way that considers both its extent and the
profile of the temperature gradient as free parameters. There are only a few
sophisticated theories of stellar convection such as Reynolds stress
approaches, but they also require the adjustment of a non-negligible number of
free parameters. We present here a theory, based on the plume theory as well as
on the mean-field equations, but without relying on the usual Taylor's closure
hypothesis. It leads us to a set of eight differential equations plus a few
algebraic ones. Our theory is essentially a non-mixing length theory. It
enables us to compute the temperature gradient in a shrinking convective core
and its overshooting zone. The case of an expanding convective core is also
discussed, though more briefly. Numerical simulations have quickly improved

ellipsoidal Gaussian, can be transformed into a semi-explicit form,
guaranteeing the stability of the implicit methods and the efficiency of the
explicit methods at the same time. We then derive an error estimate of this

communication systems to improve the transmission efficiency by adjusting the
transmission rate according to the channel conditions. Thus, AMC can provide
very efficient use of channel resources especially over fading channels.
Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) is an ef- ficient and widely employed
digital modulation technique. It typically employs a rectangular signal
constellation. Therefore the decision regions of the constellation are square
partitions of the two-dimensional signal space. However, it is well known that
hexagons rather than squares provide the most compact regular tiling in two
dimensions. A compact tiling means a dense packing of the constellation points
and thus more energy efficient data transmission. Hexagonal modulation can be
difficult to implement because it does not fit well with the usual power-
of-two symbol sizes employed with binary data. To overcome this problem,
non-binary coding is combined with hexagonal modulation in this paper to
provide a system which is compatible with binary data. The feasibility and
efficiency are evaluated using a software-defined radio (SDR) based prototype.
Extensive simulation results are presented which show that this approach can
provide improved energy efficiency and spectrum utilization in wireless
communication systems.

approaches to devalue the horn, the most common of which is dehorning. Game
theory has been used to examine the interaction of poachers and wildlife
managers where a manager can either `dehorn' their rhinos or leave the horn
attached and poachers may behave `selectively' or `indiscriminately'. The
approach described in this paper builds on this previous work and investigates
the interactions between the poachers. We build an evolutionary game theoretic

different populations of poachers. The purpose of this work is to discover
whether conditions which encourage the poachers to behave selectively exist,
that is, they only kill those rhinos with full horns.
  The analytical results show that full devaluation of all rhinos will likely
lead to indiscriminate poaching. In turn it shows that devaluing of rhinos can
only be effective when implemented along with a strong disincentive framework.
This paper aims to contribute to the necessary research required for informed

wide range of viewpoints and angles, even in the presence of optical

moving a tool or end-point to a desired location using primarily visual
feedback. In this paper, we study how viewpoint-invariant visual servoing
skills can be learned automatically in a robotic manipulation scenario. To this
end, we train a deep recurrent controller that can automatically determine
which actions move the end-point of a robotic arm to a desired object. The
problem that must be solved by this controller is fundamentally ambiguous:
under severe variation in viewpoint, it may be impossible to determine the
actions in a single feedforward operation. Instead, our visual servoing system
must use its memory of past movements to understand how the actions affect the
robot motion from the current viewpoint, correcting mistakes and gradually
moving closer to the target. This ability is in stark contrast to most visual
servoing methods, which either assume known dynamics or require a calibration
phase. We show how we can learn this recurrent controller using simulated data
and a reinforcement learning objective. We then describe how the resulting
model can be transferred to a real-world robot by disentangling perception from

few rowers to hundreds of rowers and we investigate the conditions for the
emergence of collective beating. When considering a small number of rowers, a
phase drift occurs, hence a bifurcation in beating frequency is observed as the
distance between rowers clusters is changed. In the case of many rowers, a
distribution of frequencies is observed. We found in particular the pattern of
the patchy structure that shows the best robustness in collective beating
behavior, as the density of cilia is varied over a wide range.

the disk warp profile, taking into account of bending wave propagation and

the disk warp is small, thereby justifying the ""flat-disk"" approximation

associated with the small disk warp/twist tends to drive the disk toward
alignment with the binary or the central star. We calculate the relevant
timescales for the alignment. We find the alignment is effective for
sufficiently cold disks with strong external torques, especially for systems
with rapidly rotating stars, but is ineffective for the majority of
star-disk-binary systems. Viscous warp driven alignment may be necessary to
account for the observed spin-orbit alignment in multi-planet systems if these

package called SENR/NRPy+. Our code extends previous implementations of the
BSSN reference-metric formulation to a much broader class of curvilinear
coordinate systems, making it ideally-suited to modeling physical
configurations with approximate or exact symmetries. In the context of modeling
black hole dynamics, it is orders of magnitude more efficient than other widely
used open-source numerical relativity codes. NRPy+ provides a Python-based
interface in which equations are written in natural tensorial form and output
at arbitrary finite difference order as highly efficient C code, putting
complex tensorial equations at the scientist's fingertips without the need for
an expensive software license. SENR provides the algorithmic framework that
combines the C codes generated by NRPy+ into a functioning numerical relativity
code. We validate against two other established, state-of-the-art codes, and
achieve excellent agreement. For the first time we demonstrate--in the context
of puncture, trumpet, and dual black hole evolutions--nearly exponential
convergence of constraint violation and gravitational waveform errors to zero
as the order of spatial finite difference derivatives is increased, while
holding the spherical-like coordinate grids fixed at moderate resolution. Such
behavior outside the horizons is remarkable, as numerical errors do not
converge to zero inside horizons, and all points along the polar axis are
coordinate singularities. The formulation addresses such coordinate
singularities via cell-centered grids and a simple change of basis that
analytically regularizes tensor components with respect to the coordinates.
Future plans include extending this formulation to allow dynamical coordinate
grids and bispherical-like distribution of points to efficiently capture
orbiting compact binary dynamics.

mass distribution. Smooth elliptical mass profiles were previously shown to be
inadequate in reproducing the quad population. In this paper, we explore the
deviations from such smooth elliptical mass distributions. Unlike most other
work, we use a model-free approach based on the relative polar image angles of
quads, and their position in 3D space with respect to the Fundamental Surface
of Quads. The FSQ is defined by quads produced by elliptical lenses. We have
generated thousands of quads from synthetic populations of lenses with
substructure consistent with $\Lambda$CDM simulations, and found that such
perturbations are not sufficient to match the observed distribution of quads
relative to the FSQ. The result is unchanged even when subhalo masses are
increased by a factor of ten, and the most optimistic lensing selection bias is
applied. We then produce quads from galaxies created using two components,
representing baryons and dark matter. The transition from the mass being
dominated by baryons in inner radii to being dominated by dark matter in outer
radii can carry with it asymmetries, which would affect relative image angles.
We run preliminary experiments using lenses with two elliptical mass components
with nonidentical axis ratios and position angles, perturbations from
ellipticity in the form of nonzero Fourier coefficients $a_4$ and $a_6$, and
artificially offset ellipse centers as a proxy for asymmetry at image radii. We
show that combination of these effects is a promising way of accounting for
quad population properties. We conclude that the quad population provides a
unique and sensitive tool for constraining detailed mass distribution in the
centers of galaxies.

indicators of compromise (IOCs) that can be deployed to sensors to allow early
detection of the adversary in the future. Over time, the adversary will change
tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), which will also change the data
generated. If the IOCs are not kept up-to-date with the adversary's new TTPs,
the adversary will no longer be detected once all of the IOCs become invalid.
Tracking the Known (TTK) is the problem of keeping IOCs, in this case regular
expressions (regexes), up-to-date with a dynamic adversary. Our framework
solves the TTK problem in an automated, cyclic fashion to bracket a previously
discovered adversary. This tracking is accomplished through a data-driven
approach of self-adapting a given model based on its own detection
capabilities.
  In our initial experiments, we found that the true positive rate (TPR) of the
adaptive solution degrades much less significantly over time than the naive
solution, suggesting that self-updating the model allows the continued
detection of positives (i.e., adversaries). The cost for this performance is in
the false positive rate (FPR), which increases over time for the adaptive
solution, but remains constant for the naive solution. However, the difference
in overall detection performance, as measured by the area under the curve
(AUC), between the two methods is negligible. This result suggests that
self-updating the model over time should be done in practice to continue to
detect known, evolving adversaries.

our experimentally observed temperature dependence of the storage modulus of
the network with a scaling theory linking network elasticity with reversible
crosslinking enables us to quantify the endothermic binding enthalpy and an
estimate the effective size of hydrophobic patches on the fibril surface.

over the space of rank-constrained two-body reduced-density matrices (RDMs)
[Phys. Rev. A 89, 010502(R) (2014)]. This formulation of the problem transfers
the non-convexity of the Hartree-Fock energy functional to the rank constraint
on the two-body RDM. We consider an equivalent optimization over the space of
positive semidefinite one-electron RDMs (1-RDMs) that retains the non-convexity
of the Hartree-Fock energy expression. The optimized 1-RDM satisfies ensemble
$N$-representability conditions, and ensemble spin-state conditions may be
imposed as well. The spin-state conditions place additional linear and
nonlinear constraints on the 1-RDM. We apply this RDM-based approach to several

spatial-symmetry-broken solutions that are difficult to identify using standard

innovations lie in the introduction of two new linear estimates. First is the
control of the dispersive decay of the solution $\phi$ itself (as opposed to
its derivatives), via a logarithmic weighted Hardy inequality. This control has
not been previously established using purely physical space methods in two
spatial dimensions. Second is a point-wise decay estimate for a twisted
derivative of $\phi$ associated to the Morawetz $K$ multiplier, that cannot be
reduced to point-wise decay estimates associated to the standard commutator
vector fields. As the linear theory is largely similar between dimensions, and
in view of the novelty of the second innovation even in higher dimensions, we
include a discussion of the method for $\mathbb{R}^{1,d}$ in general. Both
linear estimates are used crucially in our study: the control of the wave-map
equation in the small data regime necessarily requires understanding the
dispersive behavior of the bare solution $\phi$ itself, by virtue of the
equation it satisfies. The point-wise decay for the twisted derivative allows
us to avoid certain top-order logarithmic energy growths; this is indispensable
for extending our argument from the case of compactly supported initial data
(to which our methods are most naturally adapted) to initial data that are
strongly localized but not necessarily of compact support, via an iterative
construction.

setting, the energy conserving dynamics are equivalent to the ones of the
Neumann integrable system. We take initial conditions in thermal equilibrium
and we subsequently evolve the configurations with Newton dynamics dictated by
a different Hamiltonian. We identify three dynamical phases depending on the
parameters that characterise the initial state and the final Hamiltonian. We
obtain the {\it global} dynamical observables with numerical and analytic
methods and we show that, in most cases, they are out of thermal equilibrium.
We note, however, that for shallow quenches from the condensed phase the
dynamics are close to (though not at) thermal equilibrium. Surprisingly enough,
for a particular relation between parameters the global observables comply
Gibbs-Boltzmann equilibrium. We next set the analysis of the system with finite
number of degrees of freedom in terms of $N$ non-linearly coupled modes. We
evaluate the mode temperatures and we relate them to the frequency-dependent
effective temperature measured with the fluctuation-dissipation relation in the
frequency domain, similarly to what was recently proposed for quantum
integrable cases. Finally, we analyse the $N-1$ integrals of motion and we use
them to show that the system is out of equilibrium in all phases, even for
parameters that show an apparent Gibbs-Boltzmann behaviour of global
observables. We elaborate on the role played by these constants of motion in
the post-quench dynamics and we briefly discuss the possible description of the

debugging tools, Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) are poised to meet the
increasingly stringent dependability requirements of today's communication
networks. However, the design of fault-tolerant SDNs remains an open challenge.
This paper considers the design of dependable SDNs through the lenses of
self-stabilization - a very strong notion of fault-tolerance. In particular, we
develop algorithms for an in-band and distributed control plane for SDNs,
called Renaissance, which tolerate a wide range of failures. Our
self-stabilizing algorithms ensure that after the occurrence of arbitrary
failures, (i) every non-faulty SDN controller can reach any switch (or another
controller) within a bounded communication delay (in the presence of a bounded
number of failures) and (ii) every switch is managed by a controller. We
evaluate Renaissance through a rigorous worst-case analysis as well as a
prototype implementation (based on OVS and Floodlight, and Mininet).

dissemination, easy access, and low cost. However, it also enables the wide
propagation of fake news, i.e., news with intentionally false information.
Detecting fake news is an important task, which not only ensures users to
receive authentic information but also help maintain a trustworthy news
ecosystem. The majority of existing detection algorithms focus on finding clues
from news contents, which are generally not effective because fake news is
often intentionally written to mislead users by mimicking true news. Therefore,
we need to explore auxiliary information to improve detection. The social
context during news dissemination process on social media forms the inherent
tri-relationship, the relationship among publishers, news pieces, and users,
which has potential to improve fake news detection. For example,
partisan-biased publishers are more likely to publish fake news, and
low-credible users are more likely to share fake news. In this paper, we study
the novel problem of exploiting social context for fake news detection. We
propose a tri-relationship embedding framework TriFN, which models
publisher-news relations and user-news interactions simultaneously for fake
news classification. We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets, which
demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms other baseline

mechanisms that rule spin state stabilisation remain elusive. Here, it is
demonstrated by using multiconfigurational quantum chemical approaches,
including the novel Stochastic-CASSCF method, that electron delocalization
between the metal centre and the pi system of the macrocycle differentially
stabilises the triplet spin states over the quintet. This delocalisation takes
place via charge-transfer excitations, involving the out-of-plane iron d
orbitals, key linking orbitals between metal and macrocycle. Through a
correlated breathing mechanism, the 3d electrons can make transitions towards
the pi orbitals of the macrocycle. This guarantees a strong coupling between
the on-site radial correlation on the metal and electron delocalization.
Opposite-spin 3d electrons of the triplet can effectively reduce electron
repulsion in this manner. Constraining the out-of-plane orbitals from breathing
hinders delocalization and reverses the spin ordering. Our results find a
qualitative analogue in Kekul\'e resonance structures involving also the metal
centre.

of undergoing a Wolf-Rayet phase, and the origins of Type Ibc SNe remains
debated, including the relative importance of single massive star progenitors
or lower mass stars stripped in binaries. We present an analysis of the ages
and spatial distributions of massive stars around the sites of 23
stripped-envelope SNe, as observed with the Hubble Space Telescope, to probe
the possible origins of the progenitors of these events. Using a Bayesian
stellar populations analysis scheme, we find characteristic ages for the
populations observed within $150\,\mathrm{pc}$ of the target Type IIb, Ib and
Ic SNe to be $\log (t) = 7.20$, $7.05$ and $6.57$, respectively. The Type Ic
SNe in the sample are nearly all observed within $100\,\mathrm{pc}$ of young,
dense stellar populations. The environment around SN 2002ap is an important
exception both in terms of age and spatial properties. These findings may
support the hypothesis that stars with $M_{init} > 30M_{\odot}$ produce a
relatively large proportion of Type Ibc SNe, and that these SN subtypes arise
from progressively more massive progenitors. Significantly higher extinctions
are derived towards the populations hosting these SNe than previously used in
analysis of constraints from pre-explosion observations. The large initial
masses inferred for the progenitors are in stark contrast with the low ejecta
masses estimated from SN light curves.

differential piston evolution between the used telescopes. This is classically
done by the use of a fringe tracker. In this work, we develop a new method to
reconstruct the temporal piston variation from the atmosphere, by using
real-time data from adaptive optics wavefront sensing: the Piston
Reconstruction Experiment (P-REx). In order to understand the principle
performance of the system in a realistic multilayer atmosphere it is first
extensively tested in simulations. The gained insights are then used to apply
P-REx to real data, in order to demonstrate the benefit of using P-REx as an
auxiliary system in a real interferometer. All tests show positive results,
which encourages further research and eventually a real implementation.
Especially the tests on on-sky data showed that the atmosphere is, under decent
observing conditions, sufficiently well structured and stable, in order to
apply P-REx. It was possible to conveniently reconstruct the piston evolution
in two-thirds of the datasets from good observing conditions (r$_0$ $\sim$ 30
cm). The main conclusion is that applying the piston reconstruction in a real
system would reduce the piston variation from around 10 $\mu$m down to 1-2
$\mu$m over timescales of up to two seconds. This suggests an application for
mid-infrared interferometry, for example for MATISSE at the VLTI or the LBTI.
P-REx therefore provides the possibility to improve interferometric
measurements without the need for more complex AO systems than already in
regular use at 8m-class telescopes.

physics used to explain the operation of electronic devices treats the
(imperfect) semiconductor crystal as a uniform effective medium in which
positively and negatively charged quasi-particles mostly obey Newtonian
dynamics, and in which the chemistry of impurity atoms is far different from
that of those same atoms in free space. The connection between these two
pictures can be made by made by invoking a mathematical transformation that
takes the finite-temperature, impure device structure and algebraically
subtracts from it a perfect crystal, leaving only the residual differences to
be analyzed. This notion of the residual difference offers a conceptual basis
for understanding many aspects of semiconductor physics, including the
properties of impurity states and heterogeneous interfaces. The mesoscopic
transformation that underlies the residual-difference picture provides the
systematic way to define a concept that is essential to the understanding of
semiconductor devices: a position-dependent band structure.

Under some assumptions on the regularity of solutions of the model problem and
its adjoint, superconvergence for the scalar field variable is achieved by
either increasing the polynomial degree in the corresponding approximation
space by one or by a local postprocessing. We provide a uniform analysis that
allows to treat different test norms. Particularly, we show that in the
presence of convection only the quasi-optimal test norm leads to higher
convergence rates, whereas other norms considered do not. Moreover, we also
prove that our DPG method delivers the best $L^2$ approximation of the scalar

drawn from a Poisson point process; (3) the path loss function is bounded above
satisfying mild regularity conditions. We consider three possible definitions
of the average ASE, all of which give units of bits per second per unit
bandwidth per unit area. When there is no constraint on the minimum operational
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and instantaneous full channel

proven to saturate to a constant, which we derive in a closed form. For the

step is the evaluation of the elastic interaction forces among dislocation
ensembles. Because the pair-wise interaction between dislocations is
long-range, this force calculation step can be significantly accelerated by the
fast multipole method (FMM). We implemented and compared four different methods
in isotropic and anisotropic elastic media: one based on the Taylor series
expansion (Taylor FMM), one based on the spherical harmonics expansion
(Spherical FMM), one kernel-independent method based on the Chebyshev
interpolation (Chebyshev FMM), and a new kernel-independent method that we call
the Lagrange FMM. The Taylor FMM is an existing method, used in ParaDiS, one of
the most popular DD simulation softwares. The Spherical FMM employs a more
compact multipole representation than the Taylor FMM does and is thus more
efficient. However, both the Taylor FMM and the Spherical FMM are difficult to
derive in anisotropic elastic media because the interaction force is complex
and has no closed analytical formula. The Chebyshev FMM requires only being
able to evaluate the interaction between dislocations and thus can be applied
easily in anisotropic elastic media. But it has a relatively large memory
footprint, which limits its usage. The Lagrange FMM was designed to be a
memory-efficient black-box method. Various numerical experiments are presented
to demonstrate the convergence and the scalability of the four methods.

remote management of networks through a cloud security service (CSS) with
minimal user intervention required. To reduce costs and improve the

protection mechanism that enables rapid security policy dissemination across
all connected networks in mitigating new threats or attacks detected by the

at times when the supply is scarce and expensive. The utility informs the
aggregator of an anticipated DR event. The aggregator calls on a subset of its
pool of recruited agents to reduce their electricity use. Agents are paid for
reducing their energy consumption from contractually established baselines.
Baselines are counter-factual consumption estimates of the energy an agent
would have consumed if they were not participating in the DR program. Baselines
are used to determine payments to agents. This creates an incentive for agents
to inflate their baselines. We propose a novel self-reported baseline mechanism
(SRBM) where each agent reports its baseline and marginal utility. These
reports are strategic and need not be truthful. Based on the reported
information, the aggregator selects or calls on agents to meet the load
reduction target. Called agents are paid for observed reductions from their
self-reported baselines. Agents who are not called face penalties for
consumption shortfalls below their baselines. The mechanism is specified by the
probability with which agents are called, reward prices for called agents, and
penalty prices for agents who are not called. Under SRBM, we show that truthful
reporting of baseline consumption and marginal utility is a dominant strategy.
Thus, SRBM eliminates the incentive for agents to inflate baselines. SRBM is
assured to meet the load reduction target. SRBM is also nearly efficient since
it selects agents with the smallest marginal utilities, and each called agent
contributes maximally to the load reduction target. Finally, we show that SRBM
is almost optimal in the metric of average cost of DR provision faced by the
aggregator.

increasing attention in recent years. PR algorithms enumerate paths between

methods suffer from scalability (high RAM consumption) and feature explosion
(trains on an exponentially large number of features) problems. This paper
proposes a Context-aware Path Ranking (C-PR) algorithm to solve these problems
by introducing a selective path exploration strategy. C-PR learns global
semantics of entities in the KB using word embedding and leverages the
knowledge of entity semantics to enumerate contextually relevant paths using
bidirectional random walk. Experimental results on three large KBs show that
the path features (fewer in number) discovered by C-PR not only improve
predictive performance but also are more interpretable than existing baselines.

is found that for a complete description of system response to elastic
deformation, the variations of all the quantities of lattice wave vectors,
their density amplitudes (including the corresponding anisotropic variation and
degeneracy breaking), the average atomic density, and system volume should be
incorporated. The quantitative and qualitative results of elastic constant
calculations highly depend on the physical interpretation of the density field
used in the model, and also importantly, on the intrinsic pressure that usually
pre-exists in the model system. A formulation based on thermodynamics is
constructed to account for the effects caused by constant pre-existing stress
during the homogeneous elastic deformation, through the introducing of a
generalized Gibbs free energy and an effective finite strain tensor used for
determining the elastic constants. The elastic properties of both solid and
liquid states can be well produced by this unified approach, as demonstrated by
an analysis for the liquid state and numerical evaluations for the bcc solid
phase. The numerical calculations of bcc elastic constants and Poisson's ratio
through this method generate results that are consistent with experimental

leakage. Commodity DDR DRAM refreshes cells at the rank level. This degrades
performance significantly because it prevents an entire rank from serving
memory requests while being refreshed. DRAM designed for mobile platforms,
LPDDR DRAM, supports an enhanced mode, called per-bank refresh, that refreshes
cells at the bank level. This enables a bank to be accessed while another in
the same rank is being refreshed, alleviating part of the negative performance
impact of refreshes. However, there are two shortcomings of per-bank refresh.
First, the per-bank refresh scheduling scheme does not exploit the full
potential of overlapping refreshes with accesses across banks because it
restricts the banks to be refreshed in a sequential round-robin order. Second,
accesses to a bank that is being refreshed have to wait.
  To mitigate the negative performance impact of DRAM refresh, we propose two
complementary mechanisms, DARP (Dynamic Access Refresh Parallelization) and
SARP (Subarray Access Refresh Parallelization). The goal is to address the
drawbacks of per-bank refresh by building more efficient techniques to
parallelize refreshes and accesses within DRAM. First, instead of issuing
per-bank refreshes in a round-robin order, DARP issues per-bank refreshes to
idle banks in an out-of-order manner. Furthermore, DARP schedules refreshes
during intervals when a batch of writes are draining to DRAM. Second, SARP
exploits the existence of mostly-independent subarrays within a bank. With
minor modifications to DRAM organization, it allows a bank to serve memory
accesses to an idle subarray while another subarray is being refreshed.
Extensive evaluations show that our mechanisms improve system performance and
energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art refresh policies and the benefit
increases as DRAM density increases.

turbulence heating and qualify how these processes contribute to heating the

automatically consider shock formation and dissipation, while turbulent
dissipation is modeled via a one-point closure based on Alfv\'en wave
turbulence. Numerical simulations were conducted with different photospheric
perpendicular correlation lengths $\lambda_0$, which is a critical parameter of
Alfv\'en wave turbulence, and different root-mean-square photospheric
transverse-wave amplitudes $\delta v_0$. For the various $\lambda_0$, we obtain
a low-temperature chromosphere, high-temperature corona, and supersonic solar
wind. Our analysis shows that turbulence heating is always dominant when
$\lambda_0 \lesssim 1{\rm \ Mm}$. This result does not mean that we can ignore
the compressibility because the analysis indicates that the compressible waves
and their associated density fluctuations enhance the Alfv\'en wave reflection
and therefore the turbulence heating. The density fluctuation and the cross
helicity are strongly affected by $\lambda_0$, while the coronal temperature
and mass loss rate depend weakly on $\lambda_0$.

spatially separated in the focal plane, a single mode fiber could be used to

is the capability of preserving many of the physical properties of the system
exactly also on the discrete level: besides being conservative for mass,
momentum and total energy, also any known steady equilibrium between pressure
gradient, centrifugal force and gravity force can be exactly maintained up to
machine precision. Perturbations around such equilibrium solutions are resolved
with high accuracy and with minimal dissipation on moving contact
discontinuities even for very long computational times. This is achieved by the
novel combination of well balanced path-conservative finite volume schemes,
that are expressly designed to deal with source terms written via
nonconservative products, with ALE schemes on moving grids, which exhibit only
very little numerical dissipation on moving contact waves. In particular, we
have formulated a new HLL-type and a novel Osher-type flux that are both able
to guarantee the well balancing in a gas cloud rotating around a central
object. Moreover, to maintain a high level of quality of the moving mesh, we
have adopted a nonconforming treatment of the sliding interfaces that appear

to the realization of photon blockade in a weakly coupled OMS. The reached

at T(charge)=65K in Nd3+ co-doped LSCO ($T_{c}\simeq6$~K) [Tranquada et al.,
Nature {\bf 375} (1995) 561], Hunt et al. demonstrated that

~ 30K) share nearly identical NMR anomalies near $T_{charge}$ of the former
[Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 82} (1999) 4300]. Their inevitable conclusion that LSCO
also undergoes charge order at a comparable temperature became controversial,
because diffraction measurements at the time were unable to detect Bragg peaks
associated with charge order. Recent advances in x-ray diffraction techniques
finally led to definitive confirmations of the charge order Bragg peaks in LSCO
with an onset at as high as T(charge)=80K. Meanwhile, improved instrumental
technology has enabled routine NMR measurements that were not feasible two
decades ago. Motivated by these new developments, we revisit the charge order
transition of a LSCO single crystal based on 63Cu NMR techniques. We
demonstrate that 63Cu NMR properties of the nuclear spin $I_{z}$ = -1/2 to +1/2
central transition below T(charge) exhibit unprecedentedly strong dependence on
the measurement time scale set by the NMR pulse separation time $\tau$; a new
kind of anomalous, very broad wing-like 63Cu NMR signals gradually emerge below
T(charge) only for extremely short $\tau \lesssim 4~\mu$s, while the spectral
weight of the normal NMR signals is progressively wiped out. The NMR linewidth
and relaxation rates depend strongly on $\tau$ below T(charge), and their
enhancement in the charge ordered state indicates that charge order turns on
strong but inhomogeneous growth of Cu spin-spin correlations.

full-duplex (FD) enabled ground station (GS), and two half-duplex (HD)
air-stations (ASs) is proposed as a direct solution to the spectrum crunch
faced by the aviation industry. Closed-form outage probability and finite
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) diversity gain expressions in aeronautical
communications over Rician fading channels are derived for a successive
interference cancellation (SIC) detector. Similar expressions are also
presented for an interference ignorant (II) detector and HD-equivalent modes at
GS and ASs. Through outage and finite SNR diversity gain analysis conducted at
the nodes, and system level, residual SI and inter-AS interference are found to
be the primary limiting factors in the proposed HBD-ACS. Additional analysis
also revealed that the II and SIC detectors in the proposed HBD-ACS are
suitable for weak and strong interference scenarios, respectively. When
compared to HD-ACS, the proposed HBD-ACS achieves lower outage probability and
higher diversity gains at higher multiplexing gains when operating at low SNRs.
Finite SNR analysis also showed the possibility of the proposed HBD-ACS being
able to attain interference-free diversity gains through proper management of
residual SI. Hence, the proposed HBD-ACS is more reliable and can provide
better throughput compared to existing HD-ACS at low-to-moderate SNRs.

communication, and metrology. In recent experiments, it has been shown that
readout fidelity may be improved by performing repeated quantum non-demolition
(QND) readouts of a qubit's state through an ancilla. For a qubit encoded in a
two-level system, the fidelity of such schemes is limited by the fact that a
single error can destroy the information in the qubit. On the other hand, if a
bosonic system is used, this fundamental limit could be overcome by utilizing
higher levels such that a single error still leaves states distinguishable. In
this work, we present a robust readout scheme, applicable to bosonic systems
dispersively coupled to an ancilla, which leverages both repeated QND readouts
and higher-level encodings to asymptotically suppress the effects of
qubit/cavity relaxation and individual measurement infidelity. We calculate the
measurement fidelity in terms of general experimental parameters, provide an
information-theoretic description of the scheme, and describe its application

So far, these effects have been restricted to the optical domain. Here, we
experimentally demonstrate similar behavior in a system of artificial atoms in

radiation into free space. By controlling the vacuum coupling and excitation
energy, we directly observe exponential and partly reversible, non-Markovian

due to a redundancy or the generation of a gap. This phenomena is called an
Inverse Higgs Mechanism (IHM). However, there are cases when a Goldstone boson

show that in such cases the relevant broken symmetry can be realized, without
the aid of an associated Goldstone, if there exists a proper set of operator

consider the spontaneous breaking of boosts, rotations and conformal
transformations in the context of Fermi liquids, finding three possible paths
to symmetry realization: pure Goldstones, no Goldstones and DIHM, or some
mixture thereof. We show that in the two dimensional degenerate electron system
the DIHM route is the only consistent way to realize spontaneously broken
boosts and dilatations, while in three dimensions these symmetries could just
as well be realized via the inclusion of non-derivatively coupled Goldstone
bosons. We have present the action, including the leading order
non-linearities, for the rotational Goldstone (angulon), and discuss the

motivated by assessing the potential environmental threat of coal mining

focus on binary or discrete networks and weighted networks with known
parametric weight distributions. We propose a principled nonparametric weighted
network model based on exponential-family random graph models and local
likelihood estimation and study its model-based clustering with application to
large-scale water pollution network analysis. We do not require any parametric
distribution assumption on network weights. The proposed method greatly extends
the methodology and applicability of statistical network models. Furthermore,
it is scalable to large and complex networks in large-scale environmental

  Adaptation",,,,,"math.ST stat.ME stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper studies density estimation under pointwise loss in the setting of
contamination model. The goal is to estimate $f(x_0)$ at some
$x_0\in\mathbb{R}$ with i.i.d. observations, $$ X_1,\dots,X_n\sim
(1-\epsilon)f+\epsilon g, $$ where $g$ stands for a contamination distribution.
In the context of multiple testing, this can be interpreted as estimating the
null density at a point. We carefully study the effect of contamination on
estimation through the following model indices: contamination proportion
$\epsilon$, smoothness of target density $\beta_0$, smoothness of contamination
density $\beta_1$, and level of contamination $m$ at the point to be estimated,
i.e. $g(x_0)\leq m$. It is shown that the minimax rate with respect to the
squared error loss is of order $$
[n^{-\frac{2\beta_0}{2\beta_0+1}}]\vee[\epsilon^2(1\wedge
m)^2]\vee[n^{-\frac{2\beta_1}{2\beta_1+1}}\epsilon^{\frac{2}{2\beta_1+1}}], $$
which characterizes the exact influence of contamination on the difficulty of
the problem. We then establish the minimal cost of adaptation to contamination
proportion, to smoothness and to both of the numbers. It is shown that some
small price needs to be paid for adaptation in any of the three cases.
Variations of Lepski's method are considered to achieve optimal adaptation.
  The problem is also studied when there is no smoothness assumption on the
contamination distribution. This setting that allows for an arbitrary
contamination distribution is recognized as Huber's $\epsilon$-contamination
model. The minimax rate is shown to be $$
[n^{-\frac{2\beta_0}{2\beta_0+1}}]\vee [\epsilon^{\frac{2\beta_0}{\beta_0+1}}].
$$ The adaptation theory is also different from the smooth contamination case.
While adaptation to either contamination proportion or smoothness only costs a
logarithmic factor, adaptation to both numbers is proved to be impossible.

on a nucleus are the significant shift and broadening of the $\Delta

massless leptons, the weak process $(\nu_l,l)$ on a nucleon, according to
Adler's partially conserved axial current theorem, is connected to the pion
nucleon scattering. This mechanism is also applicable to the nucleus.
Therefore, the modification of the $\Delta$-peak in a nucleus can be seen in
the $(\nu_l,l)$ reaction since it is connected to the pion nucleus scattering.
To investigate this issue quantitatively, the double differential cross
sections of the forward going ejectile $l$ energy distribution in the
$(\nu_l,l)$ reaction are calculated in the $\Delta$-excitation region for both
proton and nucleus. The measured pion nucleon and pion nucleus scattering cross
sections in the quoted energy region are used in these reactions as input.
Since the $(\nu_l,l)$ reaction is connected to the pion induced scattering, the
features of the previous reaction is shown analogous to those of the later.

present a novel lower-granularity patch representation that properly decouples
the search subspaces of likely-buggy locations, operation types and potential
fix ingredients, enabling GP to explore the search space more effectively.
Based on this new representation, we formulate automated program repair as a
multi-objective search problem and use NSGA-II to look for simpler repairs. To
reduce the computational effort and search space, we introduce a test filtering
procedure that can speed up the fitness evaluation of GP and three types of
rules that can be applied to avoid unnecessary manipulations of the code.
Moreover, we also propose a type matching strategy that can create new
potential fix ingredients by exploiting the syntactic patterns of the existing

its variants on both seeded bugs and real-world bugs in comparison with several
state-of-the-art repair approaches. Our results verify the effectiveness and
efficiency of the search mechanisms employed in ARJA and also show its
superiority over the other approaches. In particular, compared to jGenProg (an
implementation of GenProg for Java), an ARJA version fully following the
redundancy assumption can generate a test-suite adequate patch for more than
twice the number of bugs (from 27 to 59), and a correct patch for nearly four

intended to preserve the visual features of an image after scaling. However,
common image scaling algorithms are not designed to handle human crafted
images. Attackers can make the scaling outputs look dramatically different from
the corresponding input images.
  This paper presents a downscaling attack that targets the data scaling
process in deep learning applications. By carefully crafting input data that
mismatches with the dimension used by deep learning models, attackers can
create deceiving effects. A deep learning application effectively consumes data
that are not the same as those presented to users. The visual inconsistency
enables practical evasion and data poisoning attacks to deep learning

Interactions among predictors were also considered. RESULTS: Surgery duration
decreased with the number of operations a surgeon performed in a day (P<0.001).
Also, it was found that surgery duration decreased with the number of
operations allocated to an OR as long as there were no more than four surgeries
per day in the OR (P<0.001), but increased with the number of operations if it
was more than four (P<0.01). The duration of surgery was affected by its
position in a sequence of surgeries performed by a surgeon. In addition,

serve an increasing number of users and provide diverse mobile services, we
need to improve spectrum utilization in wireless communication networks.
Although spectral efficiency (SE) can be enhanced via smart and dynamic
resource allocation, interference has become a major impediment in improving
SE. There have been numerous interference management (IM) proposals at the
interfering transmitter or the victim transmitter/receiver separately or
cooperatively. Moreover, the existing IM schemes rely mainly on the use of
channel state information (CSI). However, in some communication scenarios, the
option to adjust the interferer is not available, and, in the case of downlink
transmission, it is always difficult or even impossible for the victim receiver
to acquire necessary information for IM. Based on the above observations, we
first propose a novel IM technique, called interference steering (IS). By
making use of both CSI w.r.t. and data carried in the interfering signal, IS
generates a signal to modify the spatial feature of the original interference,
so that the steered interference at the victim receiver is orthogonal to its
intended signal. We then apply IS to an infrastructurebased enterprise wireless
local area network (WLAN) in which the same frequency band is reused by
adjacent basic service sets (BSSs) with overlapping areas. With IS, multiple
nearby APs could simultaneously transmit data on the same channel to their
mobile stations (STAs), thus enhancing spectrum reuse. Our in-depth simulation
results show that IS significantly improves network SE over existing IM
schemes.

graphs. Further, these spectra are often multi-valued at some frequencies. Our
main result is a multi-dimensional graph Fourier transform that solves such

Cartesian products, the proposed transform rearranges 1-D spectra obtained by
the conventional GFT into the multi-dimensional frequency domain, of which each
dimension represents a directional frequency along each factor graph. Thus, the
multi-dimensional graph Fourier transform enables directional frequency
analysis, in addition to frequency analysis with the conventional GFT.
Moreover, this rearrangement resolves the multi-valuedness of spectra in some
cases. The multi-dimensional graph Fourier transform is a foundation of novel
filterings and stationarities that utilize dimensional information of graph
signals, which are also discussed in this study. The proposed methods are
applicable to a wide variety of data that can be regarded as signals on

natural definitions of the multivariate graph Fourier transform and the

host halo is well-documented. However the relative impact of baryons and dark
matter in shaping this distribution is still debated. Using the simulation
Horizon-AGN, the angular distribution of satellite galaxies with respect to
their central counterpart and halo is quantified. Below one Rvir, satellites
cluster more strongly in the plane of the central, rather than merely tracing
the shape of their host halo. This is due to the increased isotropy of inner
haloes acquired through their inside-out assembly in vorticity-rich flows along
the cosmic web. While the effect of centrals decreases with distance, halos'
triaxiality increases, impacting more and more the satellite's distribution.
Effects become comparable just outside one virial radius. Above this scale, the
filamentary infall also impacts the satellites distribution, dominating above
two virial radii. The central's morphology plays a governing role: the
alignment w.r.t. the central plane is four times stronger in haloes hosting
stellar discs than in spheroids. But the impact of the galactic plane decreases
for lower satellite-to-central mass ratios, suggesting this might not hold for
dwarf satellites of the Local group. The orientation of the Milky-Way's
satellites traces their cosmic filament, their level of coplanarity is
consistent with systems of similar mass and cosmic location in Horizon-AGN.
However, the strong impact of galactic planes in massive groups and clusters
bounds the likelihood of finding a relaxed region where satellites can be used
to infer halo shape. The minor-to-major axis ratios for haloes with
log(M0/Msun)>13.5 is underestimated by 10%. This error soars quickly to 30-40%

classical secret for secret sharing in quantum mechanical ways. Most of the
results associated with quantum secret sharing are based on pure multipartite
entangled states. In reality, however, it is difficult for players to share a
pure entangled state, although they can share a state close to the state. Thus,
it is necessary to study how to perform the quantum secret sharing based on a
general multipartite state. We here present a quantum secret sharing protocol
on an $N$-qubit state close to a pure $N$-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger
state. In our protocol, $N$ players use an inequality derived from the Mermin
inequality to check secure correlation of classical key bits for secret
sharing. We show that if our inequality holds then every legitimate player can
have key bits with positive key rate. Therefore, for sufficiently many copies
of the state, the players can securely share a classical secret with high
probability by means of our protocol.

of a topological gap in recent experimental reports. Our conjecture is
confirmed by real-space Chern number calculations and large-scale quantum

controversy and suggests that a detectable topological gap can be achieved by
engineering the spatial range of spin-orbit interactions.

kinds of opposite-sign current to the total current and investigate the
relationship between the quantity and the hemispheric sign rule of helicity
(HSR) that is established by a series of previous statistical studies. The
classification of current in each hemisphere is according to the following
rule: If the product of the current and the corresponding longitudinal field
component contributes a consistent sign with reference to the HSR, it is called
""HSR-compliant"" current, or else it is called ""HSR-noncompliant"" current.
Firstly, the consistence between the butterfly diagram of the $R_{J_z}$ and the
current helicity was obtained in a statistical study. Active regions with
$R_{J_z}$ smaller than 0.5 tend to obey the HSR whereas those with $R_{J_z}$
greater than 0.5 tend to disobey the HSR. The ""HSR-compliant"" current systems
have 60\% probability of realization compared to 40\% of ""HSR-noncompliant""
current systems. Overall, the HSR is violated for active regions in which the
""HSR-noncompliant"" current is greater than the ""HSR-compliant"" current.
Secondly, the $R_{J_z}$ parameter was subsequently used to study the evolution
of current systems in the case analyses of flare-productive active regions NOAA
AR 11158 and 11283. It is found that there were ""$R_{J_z}$-quasi-stationary""

together with experimental values of critical transition temperature $T_c$ and
the superconducting coherence length $\xi_0$. Analytical expressions are
obtained for information and complexity measures. Thus $T_c$ is directly
related in a simple way with disorder and complexity. An analytical relation is
found of the Fisher Information with the energy profile of superconductivity
i.e. the ratio of surface free energy and the bulk free energy. We verify that
a simple relation holds between Shannon and Fisher information i.e. a
decomposition of a global information quantity (Shannon) in terms of two local
ones (Fisher information), previously derived and verified for atoms and
molecules by Liu et al. Finally, we find analytical expressions for generalized
information measures like the Tsallis entropy and Fisher information. We
conclude that the proper value of the non-extensivity parameter $q\simeq 1$, in
agreement with previous work using a different model, where $q\simeq 1.005$.

different concepts or representations supported by processes in the brain such

This self is prereflective, prelinguistic, and initially perhaps even largely
independent of visual inputs. Instead, somatosensory (tactile and
proprioceptive) information both before and after birth may play a key part. In
this paper, we propose that self-touch experience may be a fundamental

robustly split into several clusters, with partial synchronization of nodes

performance for constructive interference (CI) exploitation in the multiuser

optimization where we maximize the distance between the constructive region and
the detection thresholds. The cases of both strict and non-strict phase
rotation are considered and can further be formulated as convex optimization
problems. For optimization with strict phase rotation, we mathematically derive
the optimal beamforming structure with Lagrangian and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)
conditions. By formulating its dual problem, the optimization problem is
further shown to be equivalent to a quadratic programming (QP) over a simplex,
which can be solved more efficiently. We then extend our analysis to the case
of non-strict phase rotation, where it is mathematically shown that a
K-dimensional optimization for non-strict phase rotation is equivalent to a
2K-dimensional optimization for strict phase rotation in terms of the problem
formulation. The connection with the conventional zero-forcing (ZF) precoding
is also discussed. Based on the above analysis, we further propose an iterative
closed-form scheme to obtain the optimal beamforming matrix, where within each
iteration a closed-form solution can be obtained. Numerical results validate
our analysis and the optimality of the proposed iterative scheme, and further
show that the proposed closed-form scheme is more efficient than the
conventional QP algorithms with interior-point methods, which motivates the use
of CI beamforming in practical wireless systems.

But though probabilities (< 0.24%) for the missing correlations disfavor the

may be contributing to the tension. Here we aim to show that the absence of
large-angle correlations is best explained with the introduction of a non-zero
minimum wavenumber k_min for the fluctuation power spectrum P(k). We assume
that quantum fluctuations were generated in the early Universe with a
well-defined power spectrum P(k), though with a cutoff k_min not equal to 0. We
then re-calculate the angular correlation function of the CMB and compare it
with Planck observations. The Planck 2013 data rule out a zero k_min at a
confidence level exceeding 8 sigma. Whereas purely slow-roll inflation would
have stretched all fluctuations beyond the horizon, producing a P(k) with
k_min=0---and therefore strong correlations at all angles---a k_min > 0 would
signal the presence of a maximum wavelength at the time (t_dec) of decoupling.
This argues against the basic inflationary paradigm---perhaps even suggesting
non-inflationary alternatives---for the origin and growth of perturbations in
the early Universe. In at least one competing cosmology, the R_h=ct universe,
the inferred k_min corresponds to the gravitational radius at t_dec.

requires those overlaying warm absorber components to have larger distance (to
the central engine) than the X-ray NELR, which is not fully consistent with the
distance estimates found in the literature. Therefore, we reanalyze the
high-resolution spectra obtained in 2013--2014 with the Reflection Grating

interpretation of the X-ray narrow emission features. We find that the X-ray

photoionized plasma with different ionization parameters ($\log \xi=1.3$ and
$0.1$) and kinematics ($v_{\rm out}=-50$ and $-400~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$), and no
further absorption by the warm absorber components. The X-ray and optical NELR
might be the same multi-phase photoionized plasma. Both X-ray and optical NELR
have comparable distances, asymmetric line profiles, and the underlying
photoionized plasma is turbulent and compact in size. The X-ray NELR is not the
counterpart of the UV/X-ray absorber outside the line of sight because their
distances and kinematics are not consistent. In addition, X-ray broad emission
features that we find in the spectrum can be accounted for by a third
photoionized emission component. The RGS spectrum obtained in 2016 is analyzed
as well, where the luminosity of most prominent emission lines (the
\ion{O}{vii} forbidden line and \ion{O}{viii} Ly$\alpha$ line) are the same (at

develops when we place the sample in static magnetic field $B_0$. There are
excess of spins aligned along $B_0$ (spin up with lower energy) than spins
aligned opposite (spin down with higher energy) to the field $B_0$. A natural
question is what is the source of this excess spin polarization because
relaxation mechanisms can flip a up spin to a down spin and vice-versa. The
answer lies in the density of states. When a molecule with spin down flips to
spin up it loses energy. This energy goes into increasing the kinetic energy of
the molecule in the gas/solution phase. At this increased kinetic energy, there
are more rotational-translational states accessible to the molecule than at
lower energy. This increases the probability the molecule will spend in spin up
state (higher kinetic energy state). This is the source of excess polarization.
In this paper, we use an argument based on equipartition of energy to
explicitly count the excess states that become accessible to the molecule when
its spin is flipped from down to up. Using this counting, we derive the
familiar Boltzmann distribution of the ratio of up vs down spins. Although
prima facie, there is nothing new in this paper, we find the mode counting
argument for excess states interesting. Furthermore, the paper stresses the
fact that spin polarization arises from higher density of states at increased
kinetic energy of molecules.

convex hull of the graphs as points in the invariants space in order to exactly
obtain the extremal graphs and optimal bounds on the invariants for some fixed
parameters. The results obtained on the restricted finite class of graphs can
later be used to infer conjectures. This database also allows us to make
queries on those graphs. Once the conjecture defined, PHOEG goes one step
further by helping in the process of designing a proof guided by successive
applications of transformations from any graph to an extremal graph. To this
aim, we use a second database based on a graph data model.
  The paper presents ideas and techniques used in PHOEG to assist the study of
Extremal Graph Theory.

demonstrated increasing interest. Although spatial regularizers which promote
smoothness of the abundance maps have been widely used, they may overly smooth
these maps and, in particular, may not preserve edges present in the
hyperspectral image. Existing unmixing methods usually ignore these edge
structures or use edge information derived from the hyperspectral image itself.
However, this information may be affected by large amounts of noise or
variations in illumination, leading to erroneous spatial information
incorporated into the unmixing procedure. This paper proposes a simple, yet
powerful, spectral unmixing framework which incorporates external data (i.e.
LiDAR data). The LiDAR measurements can be easily exploited to adjust standard
spatial regularizations applied to the unmixing process. The proposed framework
is rigorously evaluated using two simulated datasets and a real hyperspectral
image. It is compared with competing methods that rely on spatial information
derived from a hyperspectral image. The results show that the proposed
framework can provide better abundance estimates and, more specifically, can
significantly improve the abundance estimates for pixels affected by shadows.

contributing 12 \% light in the $B$ bandpass, 10 \% in $V$, and 7 \% in $R$.
The light residuals between observations and theoretical models are
satisfactorily fitted by adopting a magnetic cool spot on the more massive
primary star. Including our 12 measurements, a total of 172 eclipse times were
used for ephemeris computations. We found that the orbital period of UZ Leo has
varied due to a periodic oscillation superposed on an upward parabolic
variation. The observed period increase at a rate of $+3.49 \times 10^{-7}$ d
yr$^{-1}$ can be plausibly explained by some combination of non-conservative
mass transfer from the secondary to the primary component and angular momentum
loss due to magnetic braking. The period and semi-amplitude of the oscillation
are about 139 yrs and 0.0225 d, respectively, which is interpreted as a
light-time effect due to a third component with a mass of $M_3 \sin i_3$ = 0.30
M$_\odot$. Because the third lights of 7$-$12 \% indicate that the circumbinary

neutral gas-phase surface chemistry. Recently, there has been a growing body of
theoretical and observational evidence suggesting that ionisation processes can
also occur. As a result, atmospheres are populated by regions composed of
plasma, gas and dust, and the consequent influence of plasma processes on dust
evolution is enhanced. This paper aims to introduce a new model of dust growth
and destruction in sub-stellar atmospheres via plasma deposition and plasma
sputtering. Using example sub-stellar atmospheres from Drift-Phoenix, we have
compared plasma deposition and sputtering timescales to those from neutral
gas-phase surface chemistry to ascertain their regimes of influence. We
calculated the plasma sputtering yield and discuss the circumstances where
plasma sputtering dominates over deposition. Within the highest dust density
cloud regions, plasma deposition and sputtering dominates over neutral
gas-phase surface chemistry if the degree of ionisation is $\gtrsim10^{-4}$.
Loosely bound grains with surface binding energies of the order of $0.1-1$ eV
are susceptible to destruction through plasma sputtering for feasible degrees
of ionisation and electron temperatures; whereas, strong crystalline grains
with binding energies of the order $10$ eV are resistant to sputtering. The
mathematical framework outlined sets the foundation for the inclusion of plasma
deposition and plasma sputtering in global dust cloud formation models of

the cycle double cover conjecture, Tutte's 5-flow conjecture, Fulkerson's

through the study of structural properties of snarks and construction of small

determining the smallest order of a nontrivial snark (that is, one which is
cyclically 4-edge-connected and has girth at least 5) of oddness at least 4.
Using a combination of structural analysis with extensive computations we prove
that the smallest order of a snark with oddness at least 4 and cyclic
connectivity 4 is 44. Formerly it was known that such a snark must have at

suggests that during differentiation a stem cell follows the steepest
descending gradient toward a stable equilibrium state which represents the
final cell type. It has been conjectured that there is an analogy to the
concept of entropy in statistical mechanics. In this context, in the
undifferentiated state the entropy would be large since fewer constraints exist
on the gene expression programs of the cell. As differentiation progresses,
gene expression programs become more and more constrained and thus the entropy
would be expected to decrease. Such an entropy decrease would, in analogy to
statistical mechanics, require some form of free energy to decrease
accordingly. In order to assess these predictions, we compute the Shannon
entropy for time-resolved single-cell gene expression data in two different
experimental setups of haematopoietic differentiation. We find that the
behaviour of this entropy measure is in contrast to these predictions. In
particular, we find that the Shannon entropy is not a decreasing function of
developmental pseudo-time but instead it increases toward the point of
commitment before decreasing again. This behaviour is consistent with an
increase in gene expression disorder observed in populations sampled at the
point of commitment. Single cells in these populations exhibit different
combinations of regulator activity that suggest the presence of multiple
configurations of a potential differentiation network as a result of multiple
entry points into the committed state.

establish a generalization of the dichotomy to accommodate FDs; hence, our
classification determines which combination of a CQ and a set of FDs admits
constant-delay enumeration with a linear-time preprocessing.
  In addition, we generalize a hardness result for cyclic CQs to accommodate a

interaction with scatterers present in biological tissues. Simulation of
synthetic ultrasound images is a challenging problem on account of inability to
accurately model various factors of which some include intra-/inter scanline
interference, transducer to surface coupling, artifacts on transducer elements,
inhomogeneous shadowing and nonlinear attenuation. Current approaches typically
solve wave space equations making them computationally expensive and slow to
operate. We propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) inspired approach
for fast simulation of patho-realistic ultrasound images. We apply the
framework to intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) simulation. A stage 0 simulation
performed using pseudo B-mode ultrasound image simulator yields speckle mapping
of a digitally defined phantom. The stage I GAN subsequently refines them to
preserve tissue specific speckle intensities. The stage II GAN further refines
them to generate high resolution images with patho-realistic speckle profiles.
We evaluate patho-realism of simulated images with a visual Turing test
indicating an equivocal confusion in discriminating simulated from real. We
also quantify the shift in tissue specific intensity distributions of the real
and simulated images to prove their similarity.

  Wagh","The Pyramid Scheme: Oblivious RAM for Trusted Processors",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modern processors, e.g., Intel SGX, allow applications to isolate secret code
and data in encrypted memory regions called enclaves. While encryption
effectively hides the contents of memory, the sequence of address references
issued by the secret code leaks information. This is a serious problem because
these leaks can easily break the confidentiality guarantees of enclaves.
  In this paper, we explore Oblivious RAM (ORAM) designs that prevent these
information leaks under the constraints of modern SGX processors. Most ORAMs
are a poor fit for these processors because they have high constant overhead
factors or require large private memories, which are not available in these
processors. We address these limitations with a new hierarchical ORAM
construction, the Pyramid ORAM, that is optimized towards online bandwidth cost
and small blocks. It uses a new hashing scheme that circumvents the complexity
of previous hierarchical schemes.
  We present an efficient x64-optimized implementation of Pyramid ORAM that
uses only the processor's registers as private memory. We compare Pyramid ORAM
with Circuit ORAM, a state-of-the-art tree-based ORAM scheme that also uses
constant private memory. Pyramid ORAM has better online asymptotical complexity
than Circuit ORAM. Our implementation of Pyramid ORAM and Circuit ORAM
validates this: as all hierarchical schemes, Pyramid ORAM has high variance of
access latencies; although latency can be high for some accesses, for typical
configurations Pyramid ORAM provides access latencies that are 8X better than
Circuit ORAM for 99% of accesses. Although the best known hierarchical ORAM has
better asymptotical complexity, Pyramid ORAM has significantly lower constant
overhead factors, making it the preferred choice in practice.

The radio emission of the cluster shows a complex system of four symmetric arcs
without known correlations with the X-ray emission. The mirror symmetry of the
radio arcs toward the center and the presence of two optical cores in the
central galaxy suggested that they may be created by pairs of precessing radio
jets powered by dual AGNs inside the cD galaxy. However, previous observations
failed to observe the second jetted AGN and the spectral trend due to radiative
age along the radio arcs, thus challenging this interpretation. The new Chandra
observation had several scientific objectives, including the search for the
second AGN that would support the jet precession model. We focus here on the
detailed study of the local properties of the thermal and non-thermal emission
in the proximity of the radio arcs, in order to get more insights into their
origin. We performed a standard data reduction of the Chandra dataset deriving
the radial profiles of temperature, density, pressure and cooling time of the
intra-cluster medium. We further analyzed the 2D distribution of the gas
temperature, discovering that the south-western junction of the radio arcs
surrounds the cool core of the cluster. We studied the X-ray SB and spectral
profiles across the junction, finding a cold front spatially coincident with
the radio arcs. This may suggest a connection between the sloshing of the
thermal gas and the nature of the radio filaments, raising new scenarios for
their origin. A possibility is that the radio arcs trace the projection of a
complex surface connecting the sites where electrons are most efficiently
reaccelerated by the turbulence that is generated by the gas sloshing. In this
case, diffuse emission embedded by the arcs and with extremely steep spectrum
should be most visible at very low radio frequencies.

unprecedented opportunity to study the earliest phases of planetary evolution,

M_E, the atmosphere is subject to extremely high escape rates, driven by the
planet's weak gravity and high thermal energy, which increase with decreasing
mass and/or increasing temperature. For higher masses, the escape is instead
driven by the absorption of the high-energy stellar radiation. A rough

low rank are frequently imposed or else the objective itself is designed to be
a non-convex function. This is especially true of algorithms that operate in
high-dimensional spaces or that train non-linear models such as tensor models
and deep networks.
  The freedom to express the learning problem as a non-convex optimization
problem gives immense modeling power to the algorithm designer, but often such
problems are NP-hard to solve. A popular workaround to this has been to relax
non-convex problems to convex ones and use traditional methods to solve the
(convex) relaxed optimization problems. However this approach may be lossy and
nevertheless presents significant challenges for large scale optimization.
  On the other hand, direct approaches to non-convex optimization have met with
resounding success in several domains and remain the methods of choice for the
practitioner, as they frequently outperform relaxation-based techniques -
popular heuristics include projected gradient descent and alternating
minimization. However, these are often poorly understood in terms of their
convergence and other properties.

amount of scattering centers. Although the superconducting transition
temperature $T_c$ is not directly related to RRR, our study evidences subtle
differences in the features of an incipient ordering mode related to a
depletion of density of states at the Fermi level. For instance, the onset
temperature of anisotropic spin-fluctuations at $T^* \approx 75$ K, and the

performance, very interdisciplinary scientists outperform specialized ones, at

heterogeneity of collaborators and to match the diversity of their network with
the diversity of their background. Collaboration sustains performance by
facilitating knowledge diffusion, acquisition and creation. Successful
scientists tend to absorb a larger fraction of their collaborators' knowledge,
and at a faster pace, than less successful ones. Collaboration also provides
successful scientists with opportunities for the cross-fertilization of ideas
and the synergistic creation of new knowledge. These results can inspire

spectral weight across the Brillouin zone, which we associate with the changes
in the Fermi-surface nesting properties related to the modified charge carrier
concentration. In particular, a strong diffuse peak at the corner of the
Brillouin zone ($R$ point), which coincides with the propagation vector of the
elusive antiferroquadrupolar (AFQ) order in CeB$_6$, is rapidly suppressed by
both La and Nd doping, like the AFQ order itself. The corresponding spectral
weight is transferred to the $X(00\frac{1}{2})$ point, ultimately stabilizing a
long-range AFM order at this wave vector at the Nd-rich side of the phase
diagram. At an intermediate Nd concentration, a broad diffuse peak with
multiple local maxima of intensity is observed around the $X$ point, evidencing
itinerant frustration that gives rise to multiple ordered phases for which
Ce$_{1-x}$Nd$_x$B$_6$ is known. On the La-rich side of the phase diagram,
however, dilution of the magnetic moments prevents the formation of a similar

  Transport","Vastly extended new version, now including computational experiments",,,,"cs.CY stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Increasingly, discrimination by algorithms is perceived as a societal and
legal problem. As a response, a number of criteria for implementing algorithmic
fairness in machine learning have been developed in the literature. This paper
proposes the Continuous Fairness Algorithm (CFA$\theta$) which enables a
continuous interpolation between different fairness definitions. More
specifically, we make three main contributions to the existing literature.
First, our approach allows the decision maker to continuously vary between
specific concepts of individual and group fairness. As a consequence, the
algorithm enables the decision maker to adopt intermediate ``worldviews'' on
the degree of discrimination encoded in algorithmic processes, adding nuance to
the extreme cases of ``we're all equal'' (WAE) and ``what you see is what you
get'' (WYSIWYG) proposed so far in the literature. Second, we use optimal
transport theory, and specifically the concept of the barycenter, to maximize
decision maker utility under the chosen fairness constraints. Third, the
algorithm is able to handle cases of intersectionality, i.e., of
multi-dimensional discrimination of certain groups on grounds of several
criteria. We discuss three main examples (credit applications; college
admissions; insurance contracts) and map out the legal and policy implications
of our approach. The explicit formalization of the trade-off between individual
and group fairness allows this post-processing approach to be tailored to
different situational contexts in which one or the other fairness criterion may
take precedence. Finally, we evaluate our model experimentally.

stable over long timescales (hundreds of ns). However, time resolved
measurements report valley lifetimes of only a few ps. This has been attributed
to mechanisms such as phonon-mediated inter-valley scattering and a precession
of the valley psedospin through electron-hole exchange. Here we use transient
spin grating to directly measure the valley depolarization lifetime in
monolayer MoSe$_{2}$. We find a fast valley decay rate that scales linearly
with the excitation density at different temperatures. This establishes the

The $r$-periodic Finsler billiard trajectories correspond to $r$-gons inscribed

companion orbiting a compact object that most likely is a low-mass black hole.
The unique source properties are likely due to the interaction of the compact
object with the heavy stellar wind of the companion. In this paper, we
concentrate on a very specific period of time prior to the massive outbursts
observed from the source. During this period, Cygnus X-3 is in a so-called
hypersoft state, where the radio and hard X-ray fluxes are found to be at their
lowest values (or non-detected), the soft X-ray flux is at its highest values,
and sporadic gamma-ray emission is observed. We will utilize multiwavelength
observations in order to study the nature of the hypersoft state. We observed
Cygnus X-3 during the hypersoft state with Swift and NuSTAR in the X-rays and
SMA, AMI-LA, and RATAN-600 in the radio. We also considered X-ray monitoring
data from MAXI and $\gamma$-ray monitoring data from AGILE and Fermi. We found
that the spectra and timing properties of the multiwavelength observations can
be explained by a scenario where the jet production is turned off or highly
diminished in the hypersoft state and the missing jet pressure allows the wind
to refill the region close to the black hole. The results provide proof of
actual jet quenching in soft states of X-ray binaries.

a population, i.e. it affects how its size and composition evolve. Here, we
study a well-mixed population of finite and fluctuating size whose growth is
limited by a randomly switching carrying capacity. This models the
environmental fluctuations between states of resources abundance and scarcity.
The population consists of two strains, one growing slightly faster than the
other, competing under two scenarios: one in which competition is solely for
resources, and one in which the slow (""cooperating"") strain produces a public
good that benefits also the fast (""freeriding"") strain. We investigate how the
coupling of demographic and environmental (external) noise affects the
population's eco-evolutionary dynamics. By analytical and computational means,
we study the correlations between the population size and its composition, and
discuss the social-dilemma-like ""eco-evolutionary game"" characterizing the
public good production. We determine in what conditions it is best to produce a
public good; when cooperating is beneficial but outcompeted by freeriding, and
when the public good production is detrimental for cooperators. Within a linear
noise approximation to populations of varying size, we also accurately analyze
the coupled effects of demographic and environmental noise on the size
distribution.

  Acoustic Sensor Networks","submitted to IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language
  Processing",,,,"cs.SD eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs), sensors typically have a
limited energy budget as they are often battery driven. Energy efficiency is
therefore essential to the design of algorithms in WASNs. One way to reduce
energy costs is to only select the sensors which are most informative, a
problem known as {\it sensor selection}. In this way, only sensors that
significantly contribute to the task at hand will be involved. In this work, we
consider a more general approach, which is based on rate-distributed spatial
filtering. Together with the distance over which transmission takes place, bit
rate directly influences the energy consumption. We try to minimize the battery
usage due to transmission, while constraining the noise reduction performance.
This results in an efficient rate allocation strategy, which depends on the
underlying signal statistics, as well as the distance from sensors to a fusion
center (FC). Under the utilization of a linearly constrained minimum variance
(LCMV) beamformer, the problem is derived as a semi-definite program.
Furthermore, we show that rate allocation is more general than sensor
selection, and sensor selection can be seen as a special case of the presented
rate-allocation solution, e.g., the best microphone subset can be determined by
thresholding the rates. Finally, numerical simulations for the application of
estimating several target sources in a WASN demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms the microphone subset selection based approaches in the
sense of energy usage, and we find that the sensors close to the FC and close
to point sources are allocated with higher rates.

characterized by the absence of static magnetism in its ground state. Instead,
the spins fluctuate in a highly correlated way down to the lowest temperatures.
The QSL is very rare and is confined to a few specific cases where the
interactions between the magnetic ions cannot be simultaneously satisfied
(known as frustration). Lattices with magnetic ions in triangular or
tetrahedral arrangements which interact via isotropic antiferromagnetic
interactions can generate such a frustration. Three-dimensional isotropic spin
liquids have mostly been sought in materials where the magnetic ions form
pyrochlore or hyperkagome lattices. Here we present a three-dimensional lattice
called the hyper-hyperkagome that enables spin liquid behaviour and manifests
in the compound PbCuTe$_{2}$O$_{6}$. Using a combination of experiment and
theory we show that this system exhibits signs of being a quantum spin liquid
with no detectable static magnetism together with the presence of diffuse
continua in the magnetic spectrum suggestive of fractional spinon excitations.

$\chi_c \to J/\psi \gamma$ and $\psi' \to J/\psi X$ decays. The production of
the decaying mesons ($\chi_c$ or $\psi'$) is also calculated within NRQCD

nonrelativistic space wave functions of the quarkonia at $r = 0$, which are
taken from potential models in the literature. We get the ratio of the

midrapidities much closer to experimental data than obtained in a recent

effects in the production of $J/\psi$ and $\chi_{c}$ mesons at forward/backward

describe ALICE and LHCb data. A mixed UGDF scenario was proposed. Then we can
describe the experimental data for $J/\psi$ production within model
uncertainties with color-singlet component only. Therefore our theoretical
results leave only a relatively small room for the color-octet contributions.

prediction is useful to the maintenance team as they can optimize and focus
their testing resources on the modules which have a higher likelihood of

metrics as predictors or features within a machine learning classification
framework. In this paper, twenty one source code metrics are computed to
develop a statistical model for predicting change-proneness modules. Since the
performance of the change-proneness model depends on the source code metrics,
they are used as independent variables or predictors for the change-proneness
model. Eleven different feature selection techniques (including the usage of
all the $21$ proposed source code metrics described in the paper) are used to
remove irrelevant features and select the best set of features. The
effectiveness of the set of source code metrics are evaluated using eighteen
different classiffication techniques and three ensemble techniques.
Experimental results demonstrate that the model based on selected set of source
code metrics after applying feature selection techniques achieves better
results as compared to the model using all source code metrics as predictors.
Our experimental results reveal that the predictive model developed using
LSSVM-RBF yields better result as compared to other classification techniques

smart cities which provide dynamic ride-sharing services according to
passengers' requests. PVs are driverless/self-driving electric vehicles which
require frequent recharging from smart grids. For such systems, the challenge
lies in both the efficient scheduling scheme to satisfy transportation demands
with service guarantee and the cost-effective charging strategy under the
real-time electricity pricing. In this paper, we study the joint transportation
and charging scheduling for PV systems to balance the transportation and
charging demands, ensuring the long-term operation. We adopt a cake cutting
game model to capture the interactions among PV groups, the cloud and smart
grids. The cloud announces strategies to coordinate the allocation of
transportation and energy resources among PV groups. All the PV groups try to
maximize their joint transportation and charging utilities. We propose an
algorithm to obtain the unique normalized Nash equilibrium point for this
problem. Simulations are performed to confirm the effects of our scheme under
the real taxi and power grid data sets of New York City. Our results show that
our scheme achieves almost the same transportation performance compared with a
heuristic scheme, namely, transportation with greedy charging; however, the
average energy price of the proposed scheme is 10.86% lower than the latter
one.

DM particle mass and coupling constants. It is interesting to ask when these
constraints can be compatible with the DM thermal production mechanism. We
address this question within the most general set of renormalisable models that
preserve Lorentz and gauge symmetry, and that extend the Standard Model by one
DM candidate of mass $m_{\rm DM}$ and one particle of mass $M_{med}$ mediating
DM-quark interactions. Our analysis divides into two parts. First, we postulate
that XENONnT/LZ has detected $\mu_S\sim\mathcal{O}(100)$ signal events, and use
this input to calculate the DM relic density, $\Omega_{DM} h^2$. Then, we
identify the regions in the $M_{med} - \Omega_{DM} h^2$ plane which are
compatible with the observed signal and with current CMB data. We find that for
most of the models considered here, $\mathcal{O}(100)$ signal events at
XENONnT/LZ and the DM thermal production are only compatible for resonant DM
annihilations, i.e. for $M_{med}\simeq2 m_{DM}$. In this case, XENONnT/LZ would
be able to simultaneously measure $m_{DM}$ and $M_{med}$. We also discuss the
dependence of our results on $m_{DM}$, $\mu_S$ and the DM spin, and provide
analytic expressions for annihilation cross-sections and mediator decay widths

as a power $\alpha$ of the inverse of their distance. We point out the
necessity of distinguishing between energy flows towards/from the reservoirs
and those within the system. We show that energy flow between the reservoirs
occurs via a direct transfer induced by long-range couplings and a diffusive
process through the chain. To this aim, we introduce a decomposition of the
steady-state heat current that explicitly accounts for such direct transfer of
energy between the reservoir. For $0\leq \alpha<1$, the direct transfer term
dominates, meaning that the system can be effectively described as a set of
oscillators each interacting with the thermal baths. Also, the heat current
exchanged with the reservoirs depends on the size of the thermalised regions:
in the case in which such size is proportional to the system size $N$, the
stationary current is independent on $N$. For $\alpha > 1$, heat transport
mostly occurs through diffusion along the chain: for the rotors transport is
normal, while for FPU the data are compatible with an anomalous diffusion,
possibly with an $\alpha$ -dependent characteristic exponent.

solutions that start in the UV at an $AdS_5$ vacuum and end up at the same
vacuum in the IR. The RG flows are driven by deformations by relevant operators
that explicitly break translation invariance. For specific models, such that
they admit another $AdS_5$ solution, $AdS_5^c$, we show that for large enough
deformations the RG flows approach an intermediate scaling regime with
approximate conformal invariance governed by $AdS^c_5$. For these flows we
calculate the holographic entanglement entropy and the entropic $c$-function
for the RG flows. The latter is not monotonic, but it does encapsulate the
degrees of freedom in each scaling region. For a different set of models, we
find boomerang RG flows with intermediate scaling governed by an
$AdS_2\times\mathbb{R}^3$ solution which breaks translation invariance.
Furthermore, for large enough deformations these models have interesting and
novel thermal insulating ground states for which the entropy vanishes as the
temperature goes to zero, but not as a power-law. Remarkably, the thermal
diffusivity and the butterfly velocity for these new insulating ground states
are related via $D=Ev^2_B/(2\pi T)$, with $E(T)\to 0.5$ as $T\to 0$.

the breathing mode (size oscillation) dynamics of the trapped gas and the

long-time relaxation and possible thermalization of the finite isolated gas. We

increasing for larger interactions. We explain these dependences in terms of
slowing-down or speeding-up effects of two-body collision processes. We find

This is accomplished by identifying the classifying space of the

$E_\infty$-spaces. This generalizes the celebrated result of
Galatius-Madsen-Tillmann-Weiss in the case $n=1$, and of Bokstedt-Madsen in the

Tomography (OCT) and Adaptive Optics systems, in vivo imaging of many of these
cells is limited by the fact that cell contrast in reflection is extremely low.
Here, we report on a major advance by proposing and demonstrating a radically
different method compared with OCT to visualize retinal cells with high
contrast, resolution and an acquisition time suitable for clinical use. The
method uses a transscleral illumination which provides a high numerical
aperture in a dark field configuration. The light backscattered by the Retinal
Pigment Epithelium (RPE) and the choroid provides a forward illumination for
the upper layer of the retina, thus providing a transmission illumination
condition. By collecting the scattered light through the pupil, the partially
coherent illumination produces dark field images, which are combined to
reconstruct a quasi-quantitative phase image with twice the numerical aperture
given by the eye's pupil. The retrieved quasi-quantitative phase images (QPI)
of cells in ex vivo human and pig's eyes are validated with those taken with a
standard QPI system. We then apply the technique in vivo on human eye, without
pupil dilation, we demonstrated the feasibility to image retinal cells up to
the retinal pigment epithelium within a few seconds.

emergent effects, despite inherent noise in communication. While man-made
systems often employ intricate structural solutions to overcome noise, the
structure of many biological systems is more amorphous. It is not well
understood how communication noise may affect the computational repertoire of
such groups. To approach this question we consider the basic collective task of
rumor spreading, in which information from few knowledgeable sources must
reliably flow into the rest of the population.
  In order to study the effect of communication noise on the ability of groups
that lack stable structures to efficiently solve this task, we consider a noisy
version of the uniform PULL model. We prove a lower bound which implies that,
in the presence of even moderate levels of noise that affect all facets of the
communication, no scheme can significantly outperform the trivial one in which
agents have to wait until directly interacting with the sources. Our results
thus show an exponential separation between the uniform PUSH and PULL
communication models in the presence of noise. Such separation may be
interpreted as suggesting that, in order to achieve efficient rumor spreading,
a system must exhibit either some degree of structural stability or,
alternatively, some facet of the communication which is immune to noise.

Theoretically, our calculation relies on a deconfining SU(2) rather than a U(1)
photon gas. We prove that $\nu_{\rm CMB}=\left(1/4\right)^{1/3}=0.629960(5)$,
representing a topological invariant. Interestingly, the relative deviation of
$\nu_{\rm CMB}$ from the critical exponent associated with the correlation
length $l$ of the 3D Ising model, $\nu_{\rm Ising}=0.629971(4)$, is less than
$2\times 10^{-5}$. We are not yet in a position to establish a rigorous
theoretical link between $\nu_{\rm CMB}$ and $\nu_{\rm Ising}$ as suggested by
the topological nature of $\nu_{\rm CMB}$ and the fact that both theories share
a universality class. We do, however, line out a somewhat speculative map from
the physical Ising temperature $\theta$ to a fictitious SU(2) Yang-Mills
temperature $T$, the latter continuing the asymptotic behavior of the scale
factor $a$ on $T/T_0$ for $T/T_0\gg 1$ down to $T=0$, and an exponential map
from $a$ to $l$ to reproduce critical Ising behavior.

Messages travel in hops via other users, used as relays. Their trajectories are
chosen at random according to a Gibbs distribution, which favours trajectories
with low interference, measured in terms of signal-to-interference ratio. This
model was introduced in our earlier paper [KT18], where we expressed, in the
limit of a high density of users, the typical distribution of the family of
trajectories in terms of a law of large numbers. In the present work, we derive
its qualitative properties. We analytically identify the emerging typical
scenarios in three extreme regimes. We analyse the typical number of hops and
the typical length of a hop, and the deviation of the trajectory from the
straight line, (1) in the limit of a large communication area and large
distances, and (2) in the limit of a strong interference weight. In both
regimes, the typical trajectory approaches a straight line quickly, in regime
(1) with equal hop lengths. Interestingly, in regime (1), the typical length of
a hop diverges logarithmically in the distance of the transmitter to the base
station. We further analyse (3) local and global repulsive effects of a densely
populated subarea on the trajectories.
