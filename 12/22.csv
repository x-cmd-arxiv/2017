as well as complex behavior. One of the hallmarks of this relaxation process
observed in the measured auto correlation function is occurrence of multiple
steps of relaxation. The shorter time relaxation is known as the
$\beta$-relaxation which is believed to be due to the motion of particles in
the cage formed by their neighbors. One the other hand longer time relaxation,
the $\alpha$-relaxation is believed to be the main relaxation process in the
liquids. The timescales of these two relaxations processes dramatically
separate out with supercooling. In spite of decades of researches, it is still
not clearly known how these relaxation processes are related to each other. In
this work we show that, there is a possible universal relation between short
time $\beta$-relaxation and the long time $\alpha$-relaxation. This relation is
found to be quite robust across many different model systems. Finally we show
that length scale obtained from the finite size scaling analysis of $\beta$
timescale is same as that of length scale associated with the dynamic
heterogeneity in both two and three dimensions.

speech analysis and parameterization. Significant research effort has been made
to dissociate the first vocal tract resonance from the glottal formant (the
low-frequency resonance describing the open-phase of the vocal fold vibration).
However few methods cope with estimation of high-frequency spectral tilt to
describe the return-phase of the vocal fold vibration, which is crucial to the
perception of vocal effort. This paper proposes an improved version of the
well-known Iterative Adaptive Inverse Filtering (IAIF) called GFM-IAIF.
GFM-IAIF includes a full spectral model of the glottis that incorporates both
glottal formant and spectral tilt features. Comparisons with the standard IAIF
method show that while GFM-IAIF maintains good performance on vocal tract
removal, it significantly improves the perceptive timbral variations associated

well-known log-layer mismatch problem. An analysis of the mean momentum-balance
shows that the modeled stress term close to the wall can dominate because of
the bulk eddy-viscosity. Consequently, the momentum-balance equation lacks a
degree-of-freedom and the mean velocity conforms to an incorrect profile to
satisfy the momentum-balance. We show that zonal enforcement of the target mass
flow-rate can be an effective strategy to introduce an additional degree of
freedom to the mean momentum-balance, which led to a significant reduction in
the log-layer mismatch. When the mass flow-rate is enforced zonally, the
filtered velocity field attains its own constant velocity-scale above the
Reynolds-averaged field, supporting the hypothesis that there exists an
artificial boundary layer above the Reynolds-averaged region. We simulate
turbulent channel flows at friction Reynolds numbers of 2000 and 5200 on coarse
meshes that would put the first point away from the wall well into the
logarithmic layer. Second-order turbulence statistics and one-dimensional
velocity spectra agree well with the direct numerical simulation benchmark data
when results are normalized by the velocity-scale extracted from the filtered
velocity field. Additionally, the error in the skin-friction coefficient for
friction Reynolds numbers of 2000 decreased from $14.1\%$ to $2.5\%$ when we
enforced the mass flow-rate zonally.

Here we will use a Siamese network to continuously compare Track images and

images that will be different and we will find a mapping that clearly
distinguishes the Switch from other possible Track anomalies. The same method
will then be extended to detect any abnormalities on the Railway Track. Railway
Transportation is unique in the sense that is has wheeled vehicles, Trains
pulled by Locomotives, running on guided Rails at very high speeds nearing 200
mph. Multiple Tracks on the Rail network are connected to each other using an
equipment called Switch or a Turnout. Switch is either operated manually or
automatically through command from a Control center and it governs the movement
of Trains on different Tracks of the network. Accurate location of these
Switches is very important for the railroad and getting a true picture of their

advanced high strength steel (AHSS) to form traditional cold-formed steel
structural members. In this study, shell finite element models are constructed,
and geometric and material nonlinear collapse analysis performed, on simulated
lipped channel cross-section cold-formed steel members roll-formed from AHSS.
AHSS sheet is currently being used in automotive applications with thickness
ranging from 0.35 to 0.8 mm (0.0138 to 0.0315 in.) and yield strengths from 350
to 1250 MPa (51 to 181 ksi). However, AHSS has not yet been employed in
cold-formed steel construction. To assess the impact of the adoption of AHSS on
cold-formed steel member strength a group of forty standard structural lipped
channel cross-sections are chosen from the Steel Framing Industry Association
product list and simulated with AHSS material properties. The stress-strain
models used in this study are based on AHSS in production, including dual-phase
and martensitic steels. The simulations consider compression with work on
bending about the major axis in progress. Three different bracing conditions
are employed so that the impact of local, distortional, and global buckling,
including interactions can be explored. Due to the higher yield stresses of
AHSS the potential for interaction and mode switching is anticipated to be
greater in these members compared with conventional mild steels. The
simulations provide a direct means to assess the increase in strength created
by the application of AHSS, while also allowing for future exploration of the
increase in buckling mode interaction, imperfection sensitivity, and strain
demands inherent in the larger capacities. The work is intended to be an
initial step in a longer-term effort to foster innovation in the application of
new steels in cold-formed steel construction.

calculated the tidal heating for a number of classical gravitational

contribution to turbulent stress, known as $\Lambda$ effect, and its quenching
as a function of rotation and magnetic field. Methods: Simulations of
homogeneous, anisotropically forced turbulence in fully periodic cubes are used
to extract the turbulent Reynolds and Maxwell stresses. Magnetic fields are
introduced by imposing a uniform large-scale field on the system. Turbulent
transport coefficients pertaining to the $\Lambda$ effect are obtained by
fitting. Results: The numerical results agree qualitatively with analytic ones
at slow rotation and low Reynolds numbers. This entails that vertical
(horizontal) transport is downward (equatorward). The existence of a
significant meridional $\Lambda$ effect is confirmed. Large-scale vorticity
generation is found at rapid rotation when the Reynolds number exceeds a
threshold value. The $\Lambda$ effect is severely quenched by large-scale
magnetic fields due to the tendency of the Reynolds and Maxwell stresses to
cancel each other. Rotational (magnetic) quenching of $\Lambda$ occurs at more
rapid rotation (at lower field strength) in simulations than in theory.
Conclusions: The current results largely confirm the earlier theoretical
results but they also offer new insights: the non-negligible meridional
$\Lambda$ effect possibly plays a role in the maintenance of meridional
circulation in stars and the appearance of large-scale vortices raises the
question of their effect on the angular momentum transport in stars. The
results regarding magnetic quenching are consistent with the strong decrease of
differential rotation in recent semi-global simulations and highlight the
importance of including magnetic effects in differential rotation models.

94, 020601(R) (2016)], in which we derived a two-dimensional hydrodynamic
theory. From the corresponding mean-field Fokker-Planck equation combined with
a self-consistent closure scheme, we derive nonlinear field equations for the
polar and the nematic order parameter, involving gradient terms of up to fourth
order. We find that the effective microswimmer dynamics depends on the coupling
between solvent flow and orientational order. For very weak coupling
corresponding to a high viscosity of the suspension, the dynamics of mesoscale
turbulence can be described by a simplified model containing only an effective
microswimmer velocity.

detail the relations between SPOD and related POD approaches from an analytical
point of view. To allow for a better grasp of the approach, an alternative
formulation is given that is based on the classic idea from Lumley that was
carried on by George. As will be shown, SPOD is closely related to POD with a

Mn-$3d$ orbitals and their separation from the O-2$p$ bands, SrMnO$_3$ is a
material where on first sight a 3-band $d$-only model should be sufficient.
However, in the present work we demonstrate that the resulting spectrum is
considerably influenced by the number of correlated orbitals and the number of

spectral structure, not observable in $d$-only models. To illustrate these
high-frequency differences we employ the recently developed Fork Tensor Product

very likely to be mislabeled. This can be problematic when deep learning is

We design an algorithm that produces physical adversarial inputs, which can

high success rate based on transferability. Furthermore, our algorithm can
compress the size of the adversarial inputs to stickers that, when attached to
the targeted object, result in the detector either mislabeling or not detecting

the coarsening of the solvent structure around a colloidal particle emerging

the coarsening mechanisms are found, depending on the composition of the binary
liquid mixture forming the solvent and on the adsorption preferences of the
colloid. For an adsorptionwise neutral colloid, as function of time the phase
being next to its surface alternates. This behavior sets in on the scale of the
relaxation time of the solvent and is absent for colloids with strong
adsorption preferences. A Janus colloid, with a small temperature difference
between its two hemispheres, reveals an asymmetric structure formation and
surface enrichment around it, even if the solvent is within its one-phase
region and if the temperature of the colloid is above the critical demixing
temperature $T_c$ of the solvent. Our phenomenological model turns out to
capture recent experimental findings according to which, upon laser

scarce. In this effort, we represent paved roads as a transportation network by
mapping intersections to nodes and road segments between the intersections to
links. We built road networks for 40 of the urban areas defined by the U.S.
Census Bureau. We developed and calibrated a model to evaluate traffic delays
using link loads. The loads may be regarded as traffic-based centrality
measures, estimating the number of individuals using corresponding road
segments. Efficiency was estimated as the average annual delay per peak-period
auto commuter, and modeled results were found to be close to observed data,
with the notable exception of New York City. Resilience was estimated as the
change in efficiency resulting from roadway disruptions and was found to vary
between cities, with increased delays due to a 5% random loss of road linkages
ranging from 9.5% in Los Angeles to 56.0% in San Francisco. The results
demonstrate that many urban road systems that operate inefficiently under
normal conditions are nevertheless resilient to disruption, whereas some more
efficient cities are more fragile. The implication is that resilience, not just
efficiency, should be considered explicitly in roadway project selection and
justify investment opportunities related to disaster and other disruptions.

with synchrotron X-ray diffraction and X-ray emission spectroscopy. MnP has an
exceedingly strong anisotropy in compressibility, with the primary compressible
direction along the b axis of the Pnma structure. X-ray emission spectroscopy
reveals a pressure-driven quenching of the spin state in MnP. Firstprinciples
calculations suggest that the strongly anisotropic compression behavior
significantly enhances the dispersion of the Mn d-orbitals and the splitting of
the d orbital levels compared to the hypothetical isotropic compression
behavior. Thus, we propose spin quenching results mainly from the significant
enhancement of the itinerancy of d electrons and partly from spin rearrangement
occurring in the split d-orbital levels near the Fermi level. This explains the
fast suppression of magnetic ordering in MnP under high pressure. The spin
quenching lags behind the occurrence of superconductivity at ~8 GPa implying
that spin fluctuations govern the electron pairing for superconductivity.

Our methodology has been applied in two real-world case studies: the 2013/14

were vaccinated in a number of locations aiming to reduce the overall

historical patterns of disease prevalence across different areas allowed us to
quantify the impact of the intervention. In addition, a qualitative evaluation
of our impact estimates demonstrated that they were in line with independent

ruled out. We devote particular attention to the analysis of the

deeply connected to some scenarios in string theory, loop quantum gravity and
noncommutative geometry. We emphasize that the severe constraints on these
quantum spacetimes, although cannot rule out theories of top-down quantum
gravity to whom are connected in various way, provide a powerful limitations of
those models that it will make sense to focus on in the future.

will consume is becoming increasingly important for precision traffic
engineering, demand-aware network resource allocation, as well as public
transportation. Measurements collection in dense urban deployments is however
complex and expensive, and the post-processing required to make predictions is
highly non-trivial, given the intricate spatio-temporal variability of mobile
traffic due to user mobility. To overcome these challenges, in this paper we
harness the exceptional feature extraction abilities of deep learning and
propose a Spatio-Temporal neural Network (STN) architecture purposely designed
for precise network-wide mobile traffic forecasting. We present a mechanism
that fine tunes the STN and enables its operation with only limited ground
truth observations. We then introduce a Double STN technique (D-STN), which
uniquely combines the STN predictions with historical statistics, thereby
making faithful long-term mobile traffic projections. Experiments we conduct
with real-world mobile traffic data sets, collected over 60 days in both urban
and rural areas, demonstrate that the proposed (D-)STN schemes perform up to
10-hour long predictions with remarkable accuracy, irrespective of the time of
day when they are triggered. Specifically, our solutions achieve up to 61%
smaller prediction errors as compared to widely used forecasting approaches,
while operating with up to 600 times shorter measurement intervals.

train an agent to automatically choose a sequence of actions for a human
annotator to produce a bounding box in a minimal amount of time. Specifically,
we consider two actions: box verification, where the annotator verifies a box
generated by an object detector, and manual box drawing. We explore two kinds
of agents, one based on predicting the probability that a box will be
positively verified, and the other based on reinforcement learning. We
demonstrate that (1) our agents are able to learn efficient annotation
strategies in several scenarios, automatically adapting to the image
difficulty, the desired quality of the boxes, and the detector strength; (2) in
all scenarios the resulting annotation dialogs speed up annotation compared to
manual box drawing alone and box verification alone, while also outperforming
any fixed combination of verification and drawing in most scenarios; (3) in a
realistic scenario where the detector is iteratively re-trained, our agents
evolve a series of strategies that reflect the shifting trade-off between
verification and drawing as the detector grows stronger.

have a position in $\mathbb{R}$ and a mass, branch at rate 1 into two daughter

theory, called the renormalization group procedure for effective particles
(RGPEP), was applied recently to single heavy-flavor QCD in order to study its
utility beyond illustration of its general features. This heavy-flavor QCD is
chosen as the simplest available context in which the dynamics of quark and
gluon bound states can be studied with the required rigor using Minkowski-space
Hamiltonian operators in the Fock space, taking the advantage of asymptotic
freedom. The effective quarks and gluons differ from the point-like canonical
ones by having a finite size $s$. Their size plays the role of renormalization
group parameter. However, instead of integrating out high-energy degrees of
freedom, our RGPEP procedure is based on a transformation of the front-form QCD
Hamiltonian from its canonical form with counterterms to the renormalized,
scale-dependent operator that acts in the Fock space of effective quanta of
quark and gluon fields, keeping all degrees of freedom intact but accounting
for them in a transformed form. We discuss different behavior of effective
particles interacting at different energy scales, corresponding to different
size s. Namely, we cover phenomena ranging from asymptotic freedom at highest
energies down to the scales at which the formation of bound states occurs. We
briefly present recent applications of the RGPEP to quarks and gluons in QCD,
which have been developed using expansion in powers of the Fock-space
Hamiltonian running coupling. After observing that the QCD effective
Hamiltonian satisfies the requirement of producing asymptotic freedom, we
derive the leading effective interaction between quarks in heavy-flavor QCD. An
effective confining effect is derived as a result of assuming that the
non-Abelian and non-perturbative dynamics causes effective gluons to have mass.

potential churners in a vast customer base. From the perspective of machine
learning, the task of predicting customer churn can be presented as a binary
classification problem. Using data on historic behavior, classification
algorithms are built with the purpose of accurately predicting the probability
of a customer defecting. The predictive churn models are then commonly selected
based on accuracy related performance measures such as the area under the ROC
curve (AUC). However, these models are often not well aligned with the core
business requirement of profit maximization, in the sense that, the models fail
to take into account not only misclassification costs, but also the benefits
originating from a correct classification. Therefore, the aim is to construct
churn prediction models that are profitable and preferably interpretable too.
The recently developed expected maximum profit measure for customer churn

important role in recent econometric literature. In this work we allow for
models with many endogenous variables and many instrument variables to achieve
identification. Because of the high-dimensionality in the second stage,
constructing honest confidence regions with asymptotically correct coverage is
non-trivial. Our main contribution is to propose estimators and confidence
regions that would achieve that. The approach relies on moment conditions that
have an additional orthogonal property with respect to nuisance parameters.
Moreover, estimation of high-dimension nuisance parameters is carried out via
new pivotal procedures. In order to achieve simultaneously valid confidence
regions we use a multiplier bootstrap procedure to compute critical values and
establish its validity.

cosmic inflation. As we demonstrate in this paper, this can be achieved in
strongly coupled supersymmetric gauge theories, such that the energy scales of
inflation and supersymmetry breaking are generated dynamically. As a
consequence, both scales are related to each other and exponentially suppressed
compared to the Planck scale. As an example, we consider a dynamical model in
which gauging a global flavor symmetry in the supersymmetry-breaking sector
gives rise to a Fayet-Iliopoulos D term. This results in successful D-term
hybrid inflation in agreement with all theoretical and phenomenological
constraints. The gauged flavor symmetry can be identified with U(1)_B-L, where
B and L denote baryon and lepton number, respectively. In the end, we arrive at
a consistent cosmological scenario that provides a unified picture of
high-scale supersymmetry breaking, viable D-term hybrid inflation, spontaneous
B-L breaking at the scale of grand unification, baryogenesis via leptogenesis,
and standard model neutrino masses due to the type-I seesaw mechanism.

the context of the recently observed deviations in the decay of the $B$ mesons.
The anomalies in the $b\rightarrow s ll$ processes can be easily fit with
partially composite second generation leptons and third generation quarks. We
establish correlation with the parameter space consistent with the flavour
anomalies in the neutral current sector and obtain predictions for rare $K$-
decay which are likely to be another candle for NP with increased precision.
Two scenarios are considered: A) Right handed muon coupled more to NP that the
corresponding muon doublets (unorthodox case). Non-universality exists in the
right handed sector. B) Standard scenario with anomalies explained primarily by
non-universal couplings to the lepton doublets. The prediction for rare
$K$-decays are different according to the scenario, thereby serving as a useful
discriminatory tool. We note that, in this setup $R(D^*)$ is at best consistent
with the SM and increasing the compositeness of the $\tau_L$ generates a net
contribution becoming below the SM expectation. This makes this framework
fairly predictive and easily verifiable. Finally, we also comment on the
implications of flavour violation in the lepton sector and present an explicit
example with the implementation of bulk leptonic MFV which helps in alleviating
the constraints.

systematic numerical study of the low-energy Andreev spectrum and supercurrents
in short and long superconductor-normal-superconductor junctions made of
nanowires with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling, where an external Zeeman
field is applied perpendicular to the spin-orbit axis. In particular, we
investigate the detailed evolution of the Andreev bound states from the trivial
into the topological phase and their relation with the emergence of MBSs. Due
to finite length, the system hosts four MBSs, two at the inner part of the
junction and two at the outer one. They hybridize and give rise to a finite
energy splitting at superconducting phase difference $\phi=\pi$, a well-visible
effect that can be traced back to the evolution of the energy spectrum with the
Zeeman field: from the trivial phase with Andreev bound states into the
topological phase with MBSs. Similarly, we carry out a detailed study of
supercurrents for short and long junctions from the trivial to the topological
phases. The supercurrent, calculated from the Andreev spectrum, is
$2\pi$-periodic in the trivial and topological phases. In the latter it
exhibits a clear \emph{sawtooth} profile at phase difference of $\pi$ when the
energy splitting is negligible, signalling a strong dependence of current-phase
curves on the length of the superconducting regions. Effects of temperature,
scalar disorder and reduction of normal transmission on supercurrents are also
discussed. Further, we identify the individual contribution of MBSs. In short
junctions the MBSs determine the current-phase curves, while in long junctions
the spectrum above the gap (quasi-continuum) introduces an important
contribution.

that expand the modeling power of the sparsity paradigm and incorporate
constraints such as group sparsity, graph sparsity, or hierarchical sparsity.
While these sparsity models offer improved sample complexity and better
interpretability, the improvements come at a computational cost: it is often
challenging to optimize over the (non-convex) constraint sets that capture
various sparsity structures. In this paper, we make progress in this direction
in the context of separated sparsity -- a fundamental sparsity notion that
captures exclusion constraints in linearly ordered data such as time series.
While prior algorithms for computing a projection onto this constraint set
required quadratic time, we provide a perturbed Lagrangian relaxation approach
that computes provably exact projection in only nearly-linear time. Although
the sparsity constraint is non-convex, our perturbed Lagrangian approach is
still guaranteed to find a globally optimal solution. In experiments, our new

popularity distribution. To evaluate the proposed framework, we compare the
performance with other caching algorithms, including Least Recently Used (LRU),
Least Frequently Used (LFU), and First-In First-Out (FIFO) caching strategies.
Meanwhile, since the Wolpertinger architecture can effectively limit the action
space size, we also compare the performance with Deep Q-Network to identify the
impact of dropping a portion of the actions. Our results show that the proposed
framework can achieve improved short-term cache hit rate and improved and
stable long-term cache hit rate in comparison with LRU, LFU, and FIFO schemes.
Additionally, the performance is shown to be competitive in comparison to Deep

the Leavitt period-luminosity relation. However, its distance is a matter of
contention, with recent advocacy for a parallax of ~10 mas, in contrast with
the Hipparcos measurement of 7.54+/-0.11 mas. We report an independent
trigonometric parallax determination, using the Fine Guidance Sensors (FGS) on
the Hubble Space Telescope. Polaris itself is too bright for FGS, so we
measured its 8th-magnitude companion Polaris B, relative to a network of
background reference stars. We converted the FGS relative parallax to absolute,
using estimated distances to the reference stars from ground-based photometry
and spectral classification. Our result, 6.26+/-0.24 mas, is even smaller than
found by Hipparcos. We note other objects for which Hipparcos appears to have
overestimated parallaxes, including the well-established case of the Pleiades.
We consider possible sources of systematic error in the FGS parallax, but find
no evidence they are significant. If our ""long"" distance is correct, the high
luminosity of Polaris indicates that it is pulsating in the second overtone of
its fundamental mode. Our results raise several puzzles, including a long
pulsation period for Polaris compared to second-overtone pulsators in the
Magellanic Clouds, and a conflict between the isochrone age of Polaris B (~2.1
Gyr) and the much younger age of Polaris A. We discuss possibilities that B is
not a physical companion of A, in spite of the strong evidence that it is, or
that one of the stars is a merger remnant. These issues may be resolved when
Gaia provides parallaxes for both stars.

representative of reality, where noise is unavoidable in both the initial state

diagonal state, starting from $n+1$ qubits in an arbitrary uncorrelated mixed
state, and subject it to parameter encoding under dephasing noise. For this
scheme, we derive a simple formula for the (quantum and classical) Fisher
information, and show that quantum enhancements do not depend on the initial
mixedness of the qubits. That is, we show that the so-called `Zeno' scaling is
attainable when the noise present in the encoding process is time
inhomogeneous. This scaling does not depend on the mixedness of the initial
probe state, and it is retained even for highly mixed states that can never be
entangled. We then show that the sensitivity of the probe in our protocol is
invariant under permutations of qubits, and monotonic in purity of the initial
state of the probe. Finally, we discuss two limiting cases, where purity is
either distributed evenly among the probes or concentrated in a single probe.

evolution, the $ n $-atom probe is globally measured at an interrogation time
chosen to minimise the error bars of the final estimate. We model explicitly a
measurement scheme which becomes optimal in a suitable parameter range, and are
thus able to calculate the total energetic expenditure of the protocol.
Interestingly, we observe that scaling up our multipartite entangled probes
offers no precision enhancement when the total available energy $ \mathcal{E} $
is limited. This is at stark contrast with standard frequency estimation, where
larger probes---more sensitive but also more ""expensive"" to prepare---are
always preferred. Replacing $ \mathcal{E} $ by the resource that places the
most stringent limitation on each specific experimental setup, would thus help
to formulate more realistic metrological prescriptions.

parameters of a central qubit interacting with a single-spin qubit. The effect
of the longitudinal, transverse and the rotating strengths of the magnetic

case, the number of peaks and consequently the size of the estimation regions
increase as the rotating magnetic field strength increases. The precision
estimation of the central qubit parameters depends on the initial state
settings of the central and the spin- qubit, either encode classical or quantum

are large if the two qubits encode classical information. In the non-resonance
case, the estimation degree depends on which of the longitudinal/transverse
strength is larger. The coupling constant between the central qubit and the
spin- qubit has a different effect on the estimation degree of the weight and
the phase parameters, where the possibility of estimating the weight parameter
decreases as the coupling constant increases, while it increases for the phase
parameter. For large number of spin-particles, namely, we have a spin-bath
particles, the upper bounds of the Fisher information with respect to the
weight parameter of the central qubit decreases as the number of the spin
particle increases. As the interaction time increases, the upper bounds appear
at different initial values of the weight parameter.

assumed known, or tracking is performed in the sensor's (relative) coordinate
frame. This assumption does not hold when the sensor, e.g., an automotive
radar, is mounted on a vehicle, and the target state should be represented in a
global (absolute) coordinate frame. Then it is important to consider the
uncertain location of the vehicle on which the sensor is mounted for MTT. In
this paper, we present a multisensor low complexity Poisson multi-Bernoulli MTT
filter, which jointly tracks the uncertain vehicle state and target states.
Measurements collected by different sensors mounted on multiple vehicles with
varying location uncertainty are incorporated sequentially based on the arrival
of new sensor measurements. In doing so, targets observed from a sensor mounted
on a well-localized vehicle reduce the state uncertainty of other poorly
localized vehicles, provided that a common non-empty subset of targets is
observed. A low complexity filter is obtained by approximations of the joint
sensor-feature state density minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD).

predicts a cosmic bounce that takes place at the Planck scale, the second order
contributions could be large enough to jeopardize the validity of the
perturbative expansion on which previous results rest. On the other hand, the
upper bounds on primordial non-Gaussianity obtained by the Planck Collaboration
are expected to play a significant role on explorations of the LQC
phenomenology. We find that the bounce in LQC produces an enhancement of
non-Gaussianity of several orders of magnitude, on length scales that were
larger than the curvature radius at the bounce. Nonetheless, we find that one
can still rely on the perturbative expansion to make predictions about
primordial perturbations. We discuss the consequences of our results for LQC

We compute persistence diagrams for simulated CMB temperature anisotropy maps

younger underlying stellar ages and higher [OII] luminosities of active

that black holes vary their properties when hosted in either star-forming or

active galaxies selected on the [NeV] line are not commonly represented in
shallow X-ray, mid-IR, or classical line diagnostics. If we consider that our

activity using fMRI. To construct a brain atlas using fMRI, data driven

rigorous data driven evaluations of the method have been performed. Moreover,
the effect of removing autocorrelation trends from fMRI time series

the earlier measurements of its absorption measure distribution (AMD)
indicating X-ray-absorbing ionic columns that decrease slowly with decreasing
ionization parameter, we employ 2D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) disk-wind models
to describe the global outflow. We compute its photoionization structure along
with the wind kinematic properties allowing us to further calculate in a
self-consistent fashion the shapes of the major X-ray absorption lines. With
the wind radial density profile determined by the AMD, the profiles of the
ensemble of the observed absorption features are determined by the two global
parameters of the MHD wind; i.e. disk inclination \theta_obs and wind density
normalization n_o. Considering the most significant absorption features in the
(~1.8A-20A) range, we show that the MHD-wind is best described by
n(r)~6.9e11(r/ro)^-1.15 [cm^-3] and \theta_obs=44deg. We argue that winds

gas-phase species with particle inception, in this work we report a detailed
analysis of the effects of molecular characteristics on physical growth of PAC
via dimerization. We have included oxygen content, mass, type of bonds (rigid
versus rotatable), and shape as main properties of the molecules and studied
their effect on the propensity of these structures to form homo-molecular and
hetero-molecular dimers. Using enhanced sampling molecular dynamics techniques,
we have computed the free energy of dimerization in the temperature range
$500-1680$~K. Initial structures used in this study were obtained from

presence of oxygen, mass, and internal bonds are tightly intertwined, and their
relative importance changes with temperature. In general, mass and the presence
of rotatable bonds are the best indicators. The results provide knowledge on
the inception step and the role that particle characteristics play during
inception. In addition, our study highlights the fact that current models that

the motion of a human counterpart may have important contextual clues for task

Wilsonian renormalization theory, is introduced. Space-time gets represented by
a boolean lattice of coarse regions, energy scales become space-time partitions
by lattice regions, and observables are elements of a projective limit with
connecting maps given by partial integration of high-energy degrees of freedom.
The framework allows for a seamless generalization of the Wick product and the
$\mathcal S$-transform to essentially arbitrary L\'evy noises, and we provide a
tool to make explicit calculations in several cases of interest, including
Gauss, Poisson and Gamma noises (we shall thereby encounter pretty familiar
polynomials, like falling factorials and Hermite polynomials).
  Armed with this, we turn to constructive quantum field theory. We adopt an
Euclidean approach and introduce a sufficient condition for reflection
positivity, based on our $\mathcal S$-transform, enabling us to construct
non-trivial quantum fields by simply specifying compatible families of
effective connected $n$-point functions. We exemplify this by producing a field
with quartic interaction in dimension $d\leq 8$. Its connected $n$-point
functions vanish except for the propagator and the connected $4$-point
function, which is that of the $\phi^4$ field up to order $\hbar$. This model
satisfies all the physical requirements of a non-trivial quantum field theory.

magnetic damping are relevant for magnon-based spintronics and low-power
wave-like computing. The excitation frequency of spin waves in YIG is rather
low in weak external magnetic fields because of its small saturation
magnetization, which limits the potential of YIG films for high-frequency
applications. Here, we demonstrate how exchange-coupling to a CoFeB film
enables efficient excitation of high-frequency perpendicular standing spin
waves (PSSWs) in nanometer-thick (80 nm and 295 nm) YIG films using uniform
microwave magnetic fields. In the 295-nm-thick YIG film, we measure intense
PSSW modes up to 10th order. Strong hybridization between the PSSW modes and
the ferromagnetic resonance mode of CoFeB leads to characteristic anti-crossing
behavior in broadband spin-wave spectra. A dynamic exchange torque at the
YIG/CoFeB interface explains the excitation of PSSWs. The localized torque
originates from exchange coupling between two dissimilar magnetization
precessions in the YIG and CoFeB layers. As a consequence, spin waves are
emitted from the YIG/CoFeB interface and PSSWs form when their wave vector
matches the perpendicular confinement condition. PSSWs are not excited when the
exchange coupling between YIG and CoFeB is suppressed by a Ta spacer layer.
Micromagnetic simulations confirm the exchange-torque mechanism.

causal ordering of events. As wait-free algorithms, they are guaranteed to
complete their operations within a finite number of steps. Stabilizing
algorithms allow the system to recover after the occurrence of transient
faults, such as soft errors and arbitrary violations of the assumptions
according to which the system was designed to behave. We present the first, to
the best of our knowledge, stabilizing vector clock algorithm for asynchronous
crash-prone message-passing systems that can recover in a wait-free manner
after the occurrence of transient faults. In these settings, it is challenging
to demonstrate a finite and wait-free recovery from (communication and crash
failures as well as) transient faults, bound the message and storage sizes,
deal with the removal of all stale information without blocking, and deal with
counter overflow events (which occur at different network nodes concurrently).
  We present an algorithm that never violates safety in the absence of
transient faults and provides bounded time recovery during fair executions that
follow the last transient fault. The novelty is that in the absence of
execution fairness, the algorithm guarantees a bound on the number of times in
which the system might violate safety (while existing algorithms might block
forever due to the presence of both transient faults and crash failures).
  Since vector clocks facilitate a number of elementary synchronization
building blocks (without requiring remote replica synchronization) in
asynchronous systems, we believe that our analytical insights are useful for
the design of other systems that cannot guarantee execution fairness.

ranging between RT and 7.5RT and heat release of 2.5RT and 10RT. The evolution
of up to 10,000 particles was calculated as the system undergoes a thermal
ignition at constant volume. Ensemble averages of 100 calculations for each
parameter set permitted to determine the ignition delay, along with a measure
of the stochasticity of the process. A well behaved convergence to large system
sizes is also demonstrated. The ignition delay calculations were compared with
those obtained at the continuum level using rates derived from kinetic theory:
the standard rate assuming that the distribution of the speed of the particles
is the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, and the perturbed rates by Prigogine and
Xhrouet [1] for an isothermal system, and Prigogine and Mahieu [2] for an
energy releasing reaction, obtained by the Chapman-Enskog perturbation
procedure. The molecular results were found in very good agreement with the
latter at low temperatures, confirming that non-equilibrium effects promote the
formation of energetic particles, that serve as seeds for subsequent reaction
events: i.e., hot spots. This effect was found to lower the ignition delay by
up to 30%. At high temperatures, the ignition delay obtained from the standard
equilibrium rate was found to be up to 60% longer than the molecular
calculations. This effect is due to the rapidity of the reactive collisions
that do not allow the system to equilibrate. For this regime, none of the
perturbation solutions obtained by the Chapman-Enskog procedure were valid.
This study thus shows the importance of non-equilibrium effects in thermal
ignition problems, for most temperatures of practical interest.

(respectively, depth) of $G$, defined as the maximal (respectively, minimal)
length of such a chain. Working over an algebraically closed field, we
calculate the length of a connected group $G$ in terms of the dimension of its
unipotent radical $R_u(G)$ and the dimension of a Borel subgroup $B$ of the
reductive quotient $G/R_u(G)$. In particular, a simple algebraic group of rank
$r$ has length $\dim B + r$, which gives a natural extension of a theorem of
Solomon and Turull on finite quasisimple groups of Lie type. We then deduce
that the length of any connected algebraic group $G$ exceeds $\frac{1}{2} \dim
G$.
  We also study the depth of simple algebraic groups. In characteristic zero,
we show that the depth of such a group is at most $6$ (this bound is sharp). In
the positive characteristic setting, we calculate the exact depth of each
exceptional algebraic group and we prove that the depth of a classical group
(over a fixed algebraically closed field of positive characteristic) tends to
infinity with the rank of the group.
  Finally we study the chain difference of an algebraic group, which is the
difference between its length and its depth. In particular we prove that, for
any connected algebraic group $G$, the dimension of $G/R(G)$ is bounded above

particular, it is unknown how gene-specific regulation mechanisms affect
kinetic rates of transcription, and whether there are common, global features
that govern these rates across a genetic network. Here, we measure nascent
transcriptional activity in the gap gene network of early Drosophila embryos
and characterize the variability in absolute activity levels across expression
boundaries. We demonstrate that boundary formation follows a common
transcriptional principle: a single control parameter determines the
distribution of transcriptional activity, regardless of gene identity, boundary
position, or enhancer-promoter architecture. By employing a minimalist model of
transcription, we infer kinetic rates of transcriptional bursting for these
patterning genes; we find that the key regulatory parameter is the fraction of
time a gene is in an actively transcribing state, while the rate of Pol II
loading appears globally conserved. These results point to a universal
simplicity underlying the apparently complex transcriptional processes

modifying Android Open Source Project (AOSP) code, adding in-house developed
proprietary software, and pre-installing third-party applications. However,
research has documented how various security problems are associated with this
customization process.
  We develop a model of the Android ecosystem utilizing the concepts of game
theory and product differentiation to capture the competition involving two
vendors customizing the AOSP platform. We show how the vendors are incentivized
to differentiate their products from AOSP and from each other, and how prices
are shaped through this differentiation process. We also consider two types of
consumers: security-conscious consumers who understand and care about security,
and na\""ive consumers who lack the ability to correctly evaluate security
properties of vendor-supplied Android products or simply ignore security. It is
evident that vendors shirk on security investments in the latter case.
  Regulators such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission have sanctioned Android
vendors for underinvestment in security, but the exact effects of these
sanctions are difficult to disentangle with empirical data. Here, we model the
impact of a regulator-imposed fine that incentivizes vendors to match a minimum
security standard. Interestingly, we show how product prices will decrease for

problems which are constrained by partial differential equations (PDEs). These
include inverse problems, control problems, and design problems. As a major
challenge, the associated optimization procedures are inherently large-scale.
To ensure computational tractability, the design of efficient and robust
iterative methods becomes imperative. To meet this challenge, this paper
introduces a fast and memory-efficient preconditioned iterative scheme for a
class of distributed optimal control problems governed by
convection-diffusion-reaction (CDR) equations. As an alternative to low-order
discretizations and Schur-complement block preconditioners, the scheme combines
a high-order spectral Galerkin method with an efficient preconditioner tailored
specifically for the CDR application. The preconditioner is matrix-free and can
be applied within linear complexity where the proportionality constant is
small. Numerical results demonstrate that the preconditioner is ideal in the
sense that appropriate Krylov subspace methods converge within a low number of
iterations, independently of the problem size and the Tikhonov regularization
parameter.

several geometric features. We propose a novel Analysis-synthesis model
Learning with Shared Features algorithm (ALSF) for classifying such images more

introduced to learn the classifier and the feature extractor at the same time.
In this way, the computation load in patch-level based image classification can
be much reduced. Crucially, we integrate into this framework the learning of a
low rank shared dictionary and a shared analysis operator, which more
accurately represents both similarities and differences in histopathological
images from distinct classes. ALSF is evaluated on two challenging databases:

this incompatibility naturally arises from the presence of multiple dimensional

scale-invariant models that feature only dimensionless parameters (such as the
adiabatic index in the ideal gas EOS). The current work extends previous
efforts intended to rectify this inconsistency, by using a scale-invariant EOS

bulk modulus for the Mie-Gr\""uneisen EOS is constructed, and its key features
are used to motivate the selection of a scale-invariant approximation form. The
remaining surrogate model parameters are selected through enforcement of the
Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions for an infinitely strong shock in a

under increased scrutiny, as critics claim that the statistical techniques

centered around competing notions of fairness and predictive accuracy, resting
on the contested use of variables that act as ""proxies"" for characteristics

that a core ethical debate surrounding the use of regression in risk

If machine learning is operationalized merely in the service of predicting
individual future crime, then it becomes difficult to break cycles of

justice system itself. We posit that machine learning should not be used for
prediction, but rather to surface covariates that are fed into a causal model
for understanding the social, structural and psychological drivers of crime. We
propose an alternative application of machine learning and causal inference

a Mach 5.92 laminar boundary layer at a transitional Reynolds number. The
adverse pressure gradient of the oblique shock causes the boundary layer to
separate from the wall, resulting in the formation of a recirculation bubble.
For sufficiently large oblique shock angles, the recirculation bubble is
unstable to three-dimensional perturbations and the flow bifurcates from its
original laminar state. We utilize Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and Global
Stability Analysis (GSA) to show that this first occurs at a critical shock
angle of $\theta = 12.9^o$. At bifurcation, the least stable global mode is
non-oscillatory, and it takes place at a spanwise wavenumber $\beta=0.25$, in
good agreement with DNS results. Examination of the critical global mode
reveals that it originates from an interaction between small spanwise
corrugations at the base of the incident shock, streamwise vortices inside the
recirculation bubble, and spanwise modulation of the bubble strength. The
global mode drives the formation of long streamwise streaks downstream of the
bubble. While the streaks may be amplified by either the lift-up effect or by
G\""ortler instability, we show that centrifugal instability plays no role in
the upstream self-sustaining mechanism of the global mode. We employ an adjoint
solver to corroborate our physical interpretation by showing that the critical
global mode is most sensitive to base flow modifications that are entirely

apply it to the extended Mount Wilson Ca H&K sample. Our main aim is to study
how the previously commonly used assumption of strict harmonicity of the
stellar cycles as well as handling of the linear trends affects the results. We
introduce three methods of different complexity, starting with the simple
Bayesian harmonic model and followed by Gaussian Process models with periodic
and quasi-periodic covariance functions. We confirm the existence of two
populations in the activity-period diagram. We find only one significant trend
in the inactive population, namely that the cycle periods get shorter with
increasing rotation. This is in contrast with earlier studies, that postulate
the existence of trends in both of the populations. In terms of rotation to
cycle period ratio, our data is consistent with only two activity branches such
that the active branch merges together with the transitional one. The retrieved
stellar cycles are uniformly distributed over the R'HK activity index,
indicating that the operation of stellar large-scale dynamos carries smoothly
over the Vaughan-Preston gap. At around the solar activity index, however,
indications of a disruption in the cyclic dynamo action are seen. Our study
shows that stellar cycle estimates depend significantly on the model applied.
Such model-dependent aspects include the improper treatment of linear trends,
while the assumption of strict harmonicity can result in the appearance of
double cyclicities that seem more likely to be explained by the
quasi-periodicity of the cycles.

investigated by computing their Lyapunov exponents (LEs). The two models
considered are PUMA (Portable University Model of the Atmosphere), a
primitive-equation simple general circulation model, and MAOOAM (Modular
Arbitrary-Order Ocean-Atmosphere Model), a quasi-geostrophic coupled
ocean-atmosphere model on a beta-plane. We wish to investigate the effect of
the different levels of filtering on the instabilities and dynamics of the
atmospheric flows. Moreover, we assess the impact of the oceanic coupling, the
dissipation scheme and the resolution on the spectra of LEs.
  The PUMA Lyapunov spectrum is computed for two different values of the
meridional temperature gradient defining the Newtonian forcing. The increase of
the gradient gives rise to a higher baroclinicity and stronger instabilities,
corresponding to a larger dimension of the unstable manifold and a larger first
LE. The convergence rate of the rate functional for the large deviation law of
the finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLEs) is fast for all exponents, which can
be interpreted as resulting from the absence of a clear-cut atmospheric
time-scale separation in such a model.
  The MAOOAM spectra show that the dominant atmospheric instability is
correctly represented even at low resolutions. However, the dynamics of the
central manifold, which is mostly associated to the ocean dynamics, is not
fully resolved because of its associated long time scales, even at intermediate
orders.
  This paper highlights the need to investigate the natural variability of the
atmosphere-ocean coupled dynamics by associating rate of growth and decay of
perturbations to the physical modes described using the formalism of the
covariant Lyapunov vectors and to consider long integrations in order to
disentangle the dynamical processes occurring at all time scales.

records (EHRs) comes the chance of enhancing health risks screening. Most
post-marketing detections of adverse drug reaction (ADR) rely on physicians'
spontaneous reports, leading to under reporting. To take up this challenge, we
develop a scalable model to estimate the effect of multiple longitudinal
features (drug exposures) on a rare longitudinal outcome. Our procedure is
based on a conditional Poisson model also known as self-controlled case series
(SCCS). We model the intensity of outcomes using a convolution between
exposures and step functions, that are penalized using a combination of
group-Lasso and total-variation. This approach does not require the
specification of precise risk periods, and allows to study in the same model
several exposures at the same time. We illustrate the fact that this approach
improves the state-of-the-art for the estimation of the relative risks both on
simulations and on a cohort of diabetic patients, extracted from the large
French national health insurance database (SNIIRAM), a SQL database built
around medical reimbursements of more than 65 million people. This work has

a faster rate, through simultaneously leveraging the level of smoothness in the
target density and the evaluation metric, which in theory remedies the mode
collapse problem reported in the literature. A minimax lower bound is
constructed to show that when the dimension is large, the exponent in the rate
for the new GAN estimator is near optimal. One can view our results as
answering in a quantitative way how well GAN learns a wide range of densities
with different smoothness properties, under a hierarchy of evaluation metrics.
As a byproduct, we also obtain improved generalization bounds for GAN with

from the research on web mining and information networks. Recent literature on
this topic has reached a consensus that node contents and link structures

unsupervised setting. However, existing methods based on shallow models often
suffer from content noise and sparsity. In this work, we propose to utilize
deep embedding for graph clustering, motivated by the well-recognized power of
neural networks in learning intrinsic content representations. Upon that, we
capture the dynamic nature of networks through the principle of influence

then detected based on the stable state of such an embedding. Unlike most
existing embedding methods that are task-agnostic, we simultaneously solve for
the underlying node representations and the optimal clustering assignments in
an end-to-end manner. To provide more insight, we theoretically analyze our
interpretation of network clusters and find its underlying connections with two
widely applied approaches for network modeling. Extensive experimental results

quasilinear wave-kinetic equation (WKE) to the full-wave regime, i.e., resolves
the wavelength scale. Unlike waves governed by manifestly quantumlike
equations, whose WMEs can be borrowed from quantum mechanics and are commonly

quantum particles. This causes unusual phase-space dynamics that is typically
not captured by the WKE. We demonstrate how to correctly model this dynamics

its nonlinear stage and saturation; (ii) we derive the tertiary-instability

(CNNs) in many computer vision tasks, understanding how they actually work
remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel two-step
understanding method, namely Salient Relevance (SR) map, which aims to shed
light on how deep CNNs recognize images and learn features from areas, referred
to as attention areas, therein. Our proposed method starts out with a
layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) step which estimates a pixel-wise
relevance map over the input image. Following, we construct a context-aware
saliency map, SR map, from the LRP-generated map which predicts areas close to
the foci of attention instead of isolated pixels that LRP reveals. In human
visual system, information of regions is more important than of pixels in
recognition. Consequently, our proposed approach closely simulates human
recognition. Experimental results using the ILSVRC2012 validation dataset in
conjunction with two well-established deep CNN models, AlexNet and VGG-16,
clearly demonstrate that our proposed approach concisely identifies not only
key pixels but also attention areas that contribute to the underlying neural
network's comprehension of the given images. As such, our proposed SR map
constitutes a convenient visual interface which unveils the visual attention of
the network and reveals which type of objects the model has learned to
recognize after training. The source code is available at

fitting the 1-day binned GeV lightcurve with multiple Gaussian function (MGF),
we propose that the typical variability timescale in the GeV band is 1--10
days. The GeV flux variation is accompanied by the spectral variation
characterized as flux-tracking, i.e., ""harder when brighter"". The GeV flux is
correlated with the optical and X-ray fluxes, and a weak correlation between
gamma-ray flux and radio flux is also observed. The gamma-ray flux is not
correlated with the optical linear polarization degree for the global
lightcurves, but they show a correlation for the lightcurves before MJD 56000.
The power density spectrum of the global lightcurve shows an obvious turnover
at ~7.7 days, which may indicate a typical variability timescale of 3C 454.3 in
the gamma-ray band. This is also consistent with the derived timescales by
fitting the global lightcurve with MGF. The spectral evolution and an increase
of the optical linear polarization degree along with the increase of the
gamma-ray flux may indicate that the radiation particles are accelerated and
the magnetic field is ordered by the shock processes during the outbursts. In
addition, the nature of 3C 454.3 may be consistent with the self-organized
criticality system, similar to Sagittarius A, and thus the outbursts are from
plasmoid ejections driven by magnetic reconnection. This may further support
the idea that the jet radiation regions are magnetized.

gate-induced metallization in the presence of oxygen for oxide materials
suggests the electrochemical effect. However, in more general scenarios, the

encoding based methods (like one-hot encoding) are inefficient in that it

relationships among IDs, either homogeneous or heterogeneous ones. In this
paper, we propose an embedding based framework to learn and transfer the
representation of IDs. As the implicit feedbacks of users, a tremendous amount
of item ID sequences can be easily collected from the interactive sessions. By
jointly using these informative sequences and the structural connections among
IDs, all types of IDs can be embedded into one low-dimensional semantic space.
Subsequently, the learned representations are utilized and transferred in four
scenarios: (i) measuring the similarity between items, (ii) transferring from
seen items to unseen items, (iii) transferring across different domains, (iv)
transferring across different tasks. We deploy and evaluate the proposed
approach in Hema App and the results validate its effectiveness.

slang and non-standard expressions to abound on the web. Despite this, slang
has been traditionally viewed as a form of non-standard language -- a form of
language that is not the focus of linguistic analysis and has largely been
neglected. In this work, we use UrbanDictionary to conduct the first
large-scale linguistic analysis of slang and its social aspects on the Internet
to yield insights into this variety of language that is increasingly used all
over the world online.
  We begin by computationally analyzing the phonological, morphological and
syntactic properties of slang. We then study linguistic patterns in four
specific categories of slang namely alphabetisms, blends, clippings, and
reduplicatives. Our analysis reveals that slang demonstrates extra-grammatical
rules of phonological and morphological formation that markedly distinguish it
from the standard form shedding insight into its generative patterns. Next, we
analyze the social aspects of slang by studying subject restriction and
stereotyping in slang usage. Analyzing tens of thousands of such slang words
reveals that the majority of slang on the Internet belongs to two major
categories: sex and drugs. We also noted that not only is slang usage not
immune to prevalent social biases and prejudices but also reflects such biases
and stereotypes more intensely than the standard variety.

In the future, the smart devices are supposed to be able to autonomously

efficiently discover a desired target device? In this paper, we propose a
Social-Aware and Distributed (SAND) scheme that achieves a fast, scalable and
efficient device discovery in the IoT. The proposed SAND scheme adopts a novel
device ranking criteria that measures the device's degree, social relationship
diversity, clustering coefficient and betweenness. Based on the device ranking
criteria, the discovery request can be guided to travel through critical
devices that stand at the major intersections of the network, and thus quickly
reach the desired target device by contacting only a limited number of
intermediate devices. With the help of such an intelligent device discovery as
SAND, the IoT devices, as well as other computing facilities, software and data

yet challenging problems in histopathology image analysis. Due to the nuclei
tiny size, significant inter-/intra-class variances, as well as the inferior
image quality, previous automated methods would easily suffer from limited
accuracy and robustness. In the meanwhile, existing approaches usually deal
with these two tasks independently, which would neglect the close relatedness
of them. In this paper, we present a novel method of sibling fully
convolutional network with prior objectness interaction (called SFCN-OPI) to
tackle the two tasks simultaneously and interactively using a unified
end-to-end framework. Specifically, the sibling FCN branches share features in
earlier layers while holding respective higher layers for specific tasks. More
importantly, the detection branch outputs the objectness prior which
dynamically interacts with the fine-grained classification sibling branch
during the training and testing processes. With this mechanism, the
fine-grained classification successfully focuses on regions with high
confidence of nuclei existence and outputs the conditional probability, which
in turn benefits the detection through back propagation. Extensive experiments
on colon cancer histology images have validated the effectiveness of our
proposed SFCN-OPI and our method has outperformed the state-of-the-art methods
by a large margin.

memory have improved tremendously, by 128x and 20x, respectively. These
improvements are mainly due to the continuous technology scaling of DRAM
(dynamic random-access memory), which has been used as the physical substrate
for main memory. In stark contrast with capacity and bandwidth, DRAM latency
has remained almost constant, reducing by only 1.3x in the same time frame.
Therefore, long DRAM latency continues to be a critical performance bottleneck
in modern systems. Increasing core counts, and the emergence of increasingly
more data-intensive and latency-critical applications further stress the
importance of providing low-latency memory access.
  In this dissertation, we identify three main problems that contribute
significantly to long latency of DRAM accesses. To address these problems, we
present a series of new techniques. Our new techniques significantly improve
both system performance and energy efficiency. We also examine the critical
relationship between supply voltage and latency in modern DRAM chips and
develop new mechanisms that exploit this voltage-latency trade-off to improve
energy efficiency.
  The key conclusion of this dissertation is that augmenting DRAM architecture
with simple and low-cost features, and developing a better understanding of
manufactured DRAM chips together lead to significant memory latency reduction
as well as energy efficiency improvement. We hope and believe that the proposed
architectural techniques and the detailed experimental data and observations on
real commodity DRAM chips presented in this dissertation will enable
development of other new mechanisms to improve the performance, energy
efficiency, or reliability of future memory systems.

flows in some sense. As an intriguing analogue to the CH equation, the
Degasperis-Procesi (DP) equation also supports the presence of peakon
solutions. Noticing that the peakon solution to the DP equation is expressed in
terms of bimoment determinants related to the Cauchy kernel, we impose opposite
time evolution on the moments and derive the corresponding bilinear equation.
The corresponding quartic representation is shown to be a continuum limit of a
discrete CKP equation, due to which we call the obtained equation finite Toda

deriving static resource bounds for sequential code, analyzing the resource
usage of message-passing concurrent processes poses additional challenges. To
meet these challenges, this article presents an analysis for statically
deriving worst-case bounds on the total work performed by message-passing
processes. To decompose interacting processes into components that can be
analyzed in isolation, the analysis is based on novel resource-aware session
types, which describe protocols and resource contracts for inter-process
communication. A key innovation is that both messages and processes carry
potential to share and amortize cost while communicating. To symbolically
express resource usage in a setting without static data structures and
intrinsic sizes, resource contracts describe bounds that are functions of
interactions between processes. Resource-aware session types combine standard
binary session types and type-based amortized resource analysis in a linear
type system. This type system is formulated for a core session-type calculus of
the language SILL and proved sound with respect to a multiset-based operational
cost semantics that tracks the total number of messages that are exchanged in a
system. The effectiveness of the analysis is demonstrated by analyzing standard
examples from amortized analysis and the literature on session types and by a
comparative performance analysis of different concurrent programs implementing
the same interface.

selected for the cell with any local topology, and a unified linear scheme can
be constructed. However, in the traditional WENO scheme on unstructured meshes,
the very large and negative weights may appear for the mesh with lower quality,
and the very large weights make the WENO scheme unstable even for the smooth
tests. In the current scheme, an optimization approach is given to deal with
the very large linear weights, and the splitting technique is considered to
deal with the negative weights obtained by the optimization approach. The
non-linear weight with a new smooth indicator is proposed as well, in which the
local mesh quality and discontinuities of solutions are taken into account
simultaneously. Numerical tests are presented to validate the current scheme.
The expected convergence rate of accuracy is obtained, and the absolute value
of error is not affected by mesh quality. The numerical tests with strong
discontinuities validate the robustness of current WENO scheme.

generation of vdW dispersion models and show that one, fractionally-ionic atom
(FIA) theory, offers close to quantitative predictions for layered structures.
Furthermore, it does so from a qualitatively correct picture of dispersion
forces. Other methods, such as D3 and optB88vdW also work well, albeit with
some exceptions. We thus argue that we are nearly vdW ready, and that some
modern dispersion methods are accurate enough to be used for nanomaterial
prediction, albeit with some caution required.

volatilities and vice-versa, this well known stylized fact usually being
referred to as leverage effect. We propose a local volatility model, given by a
stochastic differential equation with piecewise constant coefficients, which
accounts of leverage and mean-reversion effects in the dynamics of the prices.
This model exhibits a regime switch in the dynamics accordingly to a certain
threshold. It can be seen as a continuous-time version of the Self-Exciting
Threshold Autoregressive (SETAR) model. We propose an estimation procedure for
the volatility and drift coefficients as well as for the threshold level.
Parameters estimated on the daily prices of 348 stocks of NYSE and S\&P 500, on
different time windows, show consistent empirical evidence for leverageeffects.
Mean-reversion effects are also detected, most markedly in crisis periods.

biomolecular aggregates, even when these are dynamically disordered. These
equations suggest that the transport in such cases rely on both drift and
diffusion phenomena. The presence of disorder and field effects makes the
equations nonlinear and together with cooperativity, these enhance the charge
and energy transport. The generalized drift diffusion expression connects the
adiabatic band and nonadiabatic hopping transport mechanisms, well suited for
any complex organic semiconductors or assemblies of bio molecular systems. Here
we have proposed donor-acceptor (DA) reaction state model, which examines the
probability of charge transfer and the rate between two distinct transition
state identities. From our analytical equations, we suggest that charge and
energy transport property in DA states can be tuned by only a single parameter,
i.e., the chemical potential. Importantly, we find the non-equilibrium assisted
drift-diffusion transport at non- steady state regime in 2D and 3D
semiconducting devices. The numerical results clearly support our unified
analytical equations, which goes beyond Einstein's diffusion law even in quasi-

to the accumulation of multiple sinc-shaped subcarriers. In this paper, we
present a novel pulse shaping scheme for efficient spectral leakage suppression
in OFDM based physical layer of IEEE 802.11af standard. With conventional pulse
shaping filters such as a raised-cosine filter, vestigial symmetry can be used
to reduce spectral leakage very effectively. However, these pulse shaping
filters require long guard interval, i.e., cyclic prefix in an OFDM system, to
avoid inter-symbol interference (ISI), resulting in a loss of spectral
efficiency. The proposed pulse shaping method based on asymmetric pulse shaping
achieves better spectral leakage suppression and decreases ISI caused by

recorded in rest state as well as under the influence of a simplest acoustical
stimuli - a tanpura drone. The tanpura drone has a very simple yet very complex
acoustic features, which is generally used for creation of an ambiance during a
musical performance. Hence, for this pilot project we chose to study the
correlation between a simple acoustic stimuli (tanpura drone) and sonified EEG
data. Till date, there have been no study which deals with the direct
correlation between a bio-signal and its acoustic counterpart and how that
correlation varies under the influence of different types of stimuli. This is
the first of its kind study which bridges this gap and looks for a direct
correlation between music signal and EEG data using a robust mathematical
microscope called Multifractal Detrended Cross Correlation Analysis (MFDXA).
For this, we took EEG data of 10 participants in 2 min 'rest state' (i.e. with
white noise) and in 2 min 'tanpura drone' (musical stimulus) listening
condition. Next, the EEG signals from different electrodes were sonified and
MFDXA technique was used to assess the degree of correlation (or the cross
correlation coefficient) between tanpura signal and EEG signals. The variation
of {\gamma}x for different lobes during the course of the experiment also
provides major interesting new information. Only music stimuli has the ability
to engage several areas of the brain significantly unlike other stimuli (which
engages specific domains only).

  Processes",,,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we investigate a stochastic model describing the time
evolution of a polymerization process. A polymer is a macro-molecule resulting
from the aggregation of several elementary sub-units called monomers. Polymers
can grow by addition of monomers or can be split into several polymers. The
initial state of the system consists mainly of monomers. We study the time
evolution of the mass of polymers, in particular the asymptotic distribution of
the first instant when the fraction of monomers used in polymers is above some
positive threshold $\delta$. A scaling approach is used by taking the mass $N$
as a scaling parameter. The mathematical model used in this paper includes {\em
a nucleation property}: If $n_c$ is defined as the size of the nucleus,
polymers with a size less than $n_c$ are quickly fragmented into smaller
polymers, at a rate proportional to $\Phi(N)$ for some non-decreasing and
unbounded function $\Phi$. For polymers of size greater than $n_c$,
fragmentation still occurs but at bounded rates. If $T^N$ is the instant of
creation of the first polymer whose size is $n_c$, it is shown that, under
appropriate conditions, the variable $T^N{/}[\Phi(N)^{n_c{-}2}{/}N]$ converges
in distribution, and that the first instant $L_\delta^N$ when a fraction
$\delta$ of monomers is polymerized has the same order of magnitude. An
original feature proved for this model is the significant variability of the
variable $T^N$. This is a well known phenomenon observed in biological
experiments but few mathematical models of the literature have this property.
The results are proved via a series of technical estimates for occupation
measures of some functionals of the corresponding Markov processes on fast time
scales and by using coupling techniques.

development for social robotics systems. The usability of maintenance and
control features is crucial for many kinds of systems, but in the case of
social robotics we also have to take into account that (1) the humanoid robot
physically interacts with humans, (2) the conversation with children might have
different requirements in comparison to the conversation with adults. The
results of our work were implement for the humanoid PAL REEM robot, but their
core ideas can be applied for other types of humanoid robots. We developed a
web-based solution that supports the management of robot-guided tours, provides
recommendations for the users as well as allows for a visual analysis of the
data on previous tours.

far concentrated on analysing and recovering the spread of deterministic
innovations such as URLs, hashtags, and group membership. However investigating
how mentions of real-world entities appear and spread has yet to be explored,
largely due to the computationally intractable nature of performing large-scale
entity extraction. In this paper we present, to the best of our knowledge, one
of the first pieces of work to closely examine the diffusion of named entities
on social media, using Reddit as our case study platform. We first investigate
how named entities can be accurately recognised and extracted from discussion
posts. We then use these extracted entities to study the patterns of entity
cascades and how the probability of a user adopting an entity (i.e. mentioning
it) is associated with exposures to the entity. We put these pieces together by
presenting a parallelised diffusion model that can forecast the probability of
entity adoption, finding that the influence of adoption between users can be
characterised by their prior interactions -- as opposed to whether the users
propagated entity-adoptions beforehand. Our findings have important
implications for researchers studying influence and language, and for community
analysts who wish to understand entity-level influence dynamics.

mandatory preprocessing step for distributed graph processing on very large
graphs. Existing graph partitioning algorithms minimize partitioning latency by
assigning individual graph edges to partitions in a streaming manner --- at the
cost of reduced partitioning quality. However, we argue that the mere
minimization of partitioning latency is not the optimal design choice in terms
of minimizing total graph analysis latency, i.e., the sum of partitioning and
processing latency. Instead, for complex and long-running graph processing
algorithms that run on very large graphs, it is beneficial to invest more time
into graph partitioning to reach a higher partitioning quality --- which
drastically reduces graph processing latency. In this paper, we propose ADWISE,
a novel window-based streaming partitioning algorithm that increases the
partitioning quality by always choosing the best edge from a set of edges for
assignment to a partition. In doing so, ADWISE controls the partitioning
latency by adapting the window size dynamically at run-time. Our evaluations
show that ADWISE can reach the sweet spot between graph partitioning latency
and graph processing latency, reducing the total latency of partitioning plus
processing by up to 23-47 percent compared to the state-of-the-art.

supercurrent is dominated by Coulomb blockade physics, which determines the
magnetic state of the dot. In particular, in a single level quantum dot singly
occupied, the sign of the supercurrent can be reversed, giving rise to a
pi-junction. This 0-pi transition, corresponding to a singlet-doublet
transition, is then driven by the gate voltage or by the superconducting phase
in the case of strong competition between the superconducting proximity effect
and Kondo correlations. In a two-level quantum dot, such as a clean carbon
nanotube, 0-pi transitions exist as well but, because more cotunneling
processes are allowed, are not necessarily associated to a magnetic state
transition of the dot. In this proceeding, after a review of 0-pi transitions
in Josephson junctions, we present measurements of current-phase relation in a
clean carbon nanotube quantum dot, in the single and two-level regimes. In the
single level regime, close to orbital degeneracy and in a regime of strong
competition between local electronic correlations and superconducting proximity
effect, we find that the phase diagram of the phase-dependent transition is a
universal characteristic of a discontinuous level-crossing quantum transition
at zero temperature. In the case where the two levels are involved, the
nanotube Josephson current exhibits a continuous 0-pi transition, independent
of the superconducting phase, revealing a different physical mechanism of the
transition.

adatoms with $s$ or $p_z$ character binding in top, bridge, and hollow

energy and hybridization strength. We explore a wide range of different
magnitudes of these parameters by employing T-matrix calculations in the single
adatom limit and by tight-binding supercell calculations for dilute adatom
coverage. We calculate the density of states and the momentum relaxation rate
and extract the resonance level and resonance width. Top position with large
hybridization strength or, equivalently, small onsite energy, induces
resonances close to zero energy. Bridge position, compared to top, is more
sensitive to variation in the orbital tight-binding parameters. Resonances
within the experimentally relevant energy window are found mainly for bridge
adatoms with negative onsite energies. The effect of resonances from top and
bridge position on the density of states and momentum relaxation rate is
comparable and both positions give rise to power-law decay of the resonant
state in graphene. Hollow position with $s$ orbital character is affected from
destructive interference which is seen from very narrow resonance peaks in the
density of states and momentum relaxation rate. The resonant state shows no
clear tendency to power-law decay around the impurity and its magnitude
decreases strongly with lowering the adatom content in the supercell
calculations. This is in contrast to top and bridge position. We conclude our
study with a comparison to models of point-like vacancies and strong midgap
scatterers. The latter model gives rise to significantly higher momentum
relaxation rates than caused by single adatoms.

motion due to the magnetic or radio-frequency electric trapping fields
sometimes limits the performance in one dimension and severely affects the
extension to higher dimensional systems. Here, we report on the trapping of
multiple Barium ions in a single-beam optical dipole trap without

order in ensembles of up to six ions within the optical trap, measure their

the collective motion and perform spectrometry of the normal modes in the

combines advantages of optical trapping, such as state-dependent confinement
and nano-scale potentials, with the desirable properties of crystals of trapped

with small numbers of ions, it has been proposed that these properties would
allow the experimental study of many-body physics and the onset of structural

datasets. In this paper, we propose to construct large-scale artificial scenes
for traffic vision research and generate a new virtual dataset called
""ParallelEye"". First of all, the street map data is used to build 3D scene
model of Zhongguancun Area, Beijing. Then, the computer graphics, virtual
reality, and rule modeling technologies are utilized to synthesize large-scale,
realistic virtual urban traffic scenes, in which the fidelity and geography
match the real world well. Furthermore, the Unity3D platform is used to render
the artificial scenes and generate accurate ground-truth labels, e.g.,
semantic/instance segmentation, object bounding box, object tracking, optical
flow, and depth. The environmental conditions in artificial scenes can be
controlled completely. As a result, we present a viable implementation pipeline
for constructing large-scale artificial scenes for traffic vision research. The
experimental results demonstrate that this pipeline is able to generate
photorealistic virtual datasets with low modeling time and high accuracy
labeling.

Classical novae are thermonuclear explosions hosted by accreting
white dwarfs in stellar binary systems. Material piles up on top of the white
dwarf star under mildly degenerate conditions, driving a thermonuclear runaway.
The energy released by the suite of nuclear processes operating at the envelope
(mostly proton-capture reactions and beta-decays) heats the material up to peak
temperatures ranging from 100 to 400 MK. In these events, about 10-3 - 10-7
Msun, enriched in CNO and, sometimes, other intermediate-mass elements (e.g.,
Ne, Na, Mg, Al), are ejected into the interstellar medium.
  Aims. To date, most of the efforts undertaken in the modeling of classical
nova outbursts have focused on the early stages of the explosion and ejection,
ignoring the interaction of the ejecta, first with the accretion disk orbiting
the white dwarf, and ultimately with the secondary star.
  Methods. A suite of three-dimensional, SPH simulations of the interaction
between the nova ejecta, the accretion disk, and the stellar companion have
been performed to fill this gap, aimed at testing the influence of the
different parameters (i.e., mass and velocity of the ejecta, mass and geometry
of the accretion disk) on the dynamical and chemical properties of the system.
  Results. We discuss the conditions that lead to the disruption of the
accretion disk and to mass loss from the binary system. In addition, we discuss
the likelihood of chemical contamination of the stellar secondary induced by
the impact with the nova ejecta and its potential effect on the next nova
cycle.

our aim is to select an optimal set of feedback connections such that the

longer distances, through what we call global motion. For filtering, we
decompose the posterior over local and global movements into two linked

is sampled, while we track the local movement analytically using Kalman
filters. This novel filter is evaluated on point cloud data gathered
autonomously by a mobile robot over an extended period of time. We show that
tracking jumping objects is feasible, and that the proposed probabilistic

found to harbor more than one downstream charge mode, the upstream neutral
modes are found to flow with the inner charge mode - as theoretically

probed using maps of the Faraday rotation measure (RM), since a jet current
will be accompanied by a toroidal magnetic (B) field, which will give rise to a
systematic change in the RM across the jet. The aim of this study is to
identify new AGNs displaying statistically significant transverse RM gradients
across their parsec-scale jets, and to look for overall patterns in the implied
directions for the toroidal B-field components and jet currents. We have
carried out new analyses of Faraday RM maps derived from previously published
8.1, 8.4, 12.1 and 15.3 GHz data obtained in 2006 on the NRAO VLBA. In a number
of important ways, our procedures were identical to those of the original
authors, but several other key aspects of the new imaging and analysis differ
from the original methods. Our new analysis has substantially increased the
number of AGNs known to display transverse RM gradients. The collected data on
parsec and kiloparsec scales indicate that the current typically flows inward
along the jet axis and outward in a more extended region surrounding the jet,
typical to the current structure of a coaxial cable, accompanied by a
self-consistent system of nested helical B fields, whose toroidal components
give rise to the observed transverse RM gradients. These new results make it
possible for the first time to conclusively demonstrate the existence of a
preferred direction for the toroidal B-field components - and therefore of the
currents - of AGN jets. Discerning the origin of this current-field system is
of cardinal importance for understanding the physical mechanisms leading to the
formation of the intrinsic jet B field, which likely plays an important role in
the propagation and collimation of the jets; one possibility is the action of a

on these experiments, we make the following five observations: 1) optical flow
is useful for action recognition because it is invariant to appearance, 2)
optical flow methods are optimized to minimize end-point-error (EPE), but the
EPE of current methods is not well correlated with action recognition
performance, 3) for the flow methods tested, accuracy at boundaries and at
small displacements is most correlated with action recognition performance, 4)
training optical flow to minimize classification error instead of minimizing
EPE improves recognition performance, and 5) optical flow learned for the task
of action recognition differs from traditional optical flow especially inside
the human body and at the boundary of the body. These observations may
encourage optical flow researchers to look beyond EPE as a goal and guide
action recognition researchers to seek better motion cues, leading to a tighter

network which nodes correspond to the given set of indexed objects. In this
case the search of the closest object can be thought as a search of a node in a
network. A procedure in a network is called decentralized if it uses only local
information about visited nodes and its neighbors. Networks, which structure
allows efficient performing the nearest neighbour search by a decentralised
search procedure started from any node, are of particular interest especially
for pure distributed systems. Several algorithms that construct such networks
have been proposed in literature. However, the following questions arise: ""Are
there network models in which decentralised search can be performed faster?"";
""What are the optimal networks for the decentralised search?""; ""What are their
properties?"". In this paper we partially give answers to these questions. We
propose a mathematical programming model for the problem of determining an
optimal network structure for decentralized nearest neighbor search. We have
found an exact solution for a regular lattice of size 4x4 and heuristic
solutions for sizes from 5x5 to 7x7. As a distance function we use L1 , L2 and
L_inf metrics. We hope that our results and the proposed model will initiate
study of optimal network structures for decentralised nearest neighbour search.

SGD, and is sometimes quite different on non-quadratic models. This further
connects averaged SGD and natural gradient, both of which are arguably optimal

approach to achieve fault tolerance by encoding quantum information in the
non-local charge parity states of semiconductor nanowire networks in the
topological superconductor regime. Thus far, experimental studies of MZMs
chiefly relied on single electron tunneling measurements which leads to
decoherence of the quantum information stored in the MZM. As a next step
towards topological quantum computation, charge parity conserving experiments
based on the Josephson effect are required, which can also help exclude
suggested non-topological origins of the zero bias conductance anomaly. Here we
report the direct measurement of the Josephson radiation frequency in InAs
nanowires with epitaxial aluminium shells. For the first time, we observe the
$4\pi$-periodic Josephson effect above a magnetic field of $\approx 200\,$mT,
consistent with the estimated and measured topological phase transition of
similar devices.

motions is the existence of secondary resonances. For some combinations of
physical parameters, these resonances occupy a large fraction of the domain of
stability and rule the dynamics within the stable tadpole region. In this work,
we present an application of a recently introduced `basic Hamiltonian model' Hb
for Trojan dynamics, in Paez and Efthymiopoulos (2015), Paez, Locatelli and
Efthymiopoulos (2016): we show that the inner border of the secondary resonance
of lowermost order, as defined by Hb, provides a good estimation of the region
in phase-space for which the orbits remain regular regardless the orbital
parameters of the system. The computation of this boundary is straightforward
by combining a resonant normal form calculation in conjunction with an
`asymmetric expansion' of the Hamiltonian around the libration points, which
speeds up convergence. Applications to the determination of the effective
stability domain for exoplanetary Trojans (planet-sized objects or asteroids)
which may accompany giant exoplanets are discussed.

fundamental role in extending the applicability of boundary integral methods to

Overlapping partitions are placed along the boundaries, and a local extension

a trivially parallel process. A partition of unity method blends the local
extrapolations into a global one, where weight functions impose compact

construction of the partition of unity function. We evaluate the performance of
the PUX method in the context of solving the Poisson equation on multiply

combination of both) in order to quantify the reactive and resistive
contributions to the thrust. The latter has the form of a quadratic drag in
large Reynolds number swimmers and has recently been pointed out as a crucial
element in the thrust force balance. We validate the output of a weakly

different actuation types. The model is subsequently used in a self-propelled

constant cruising speed--- to map the reactive versus resistive thrust
production in a parameter space defined by the aspect ratio and the actuation
frequency. We show that this balance is modified as the frequency of excitation
changes and the response of the elastic plate shifts between different resonant
modes, the pure heaving case being the most sensitive to the modal response

ordering of the hydrocarbon tails of the DMPS molecule occurs in the monolayer
as the surface pressure rises. The monolayer thickness is (20 +/- 3) Angstrom

devices rely on exfoliation from bulk crystals, there is a need to understand
native impurities and defects in the source material. In particular, samples
are typically p-doped, but the source of the doping is not well understood.
Here, we use scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to compare atomic
defects of BP samples from two commercial sources. Even though the sources
produced crystals with an order of magnitude difference in impurity atoms, we
observed a similar defect density and level of p-doping. We attribute these
defects to phosphorus vacancies and provide evidence that they are the source

the following problem is addressed: What is the maximum information that can be
revealed about $Y$ (measured by mutual information $I(Y;U)$, in which $U$ is
the revealed data), while disclosing no information about $X$ (captured by the
condition of statistical independence, i.e., $X\independent U$, and henceforth,
called \textit{perfect privacy})? We analyze the supremization of
\textit{utility}, i.e., $I(Y;U)$ under the condition of perfect privacy for two
scenarios: \textit{output perturbation} and \textit{full data observation}
models, which correspond to the cases where a Markov kernel, called
\textit{privacy-preserving mapping}, applies to $Y$ and the pair $(X,Y)$,
respectively. When both $X$ and $Y$ have a finite alphabet, the linear
algebraic analysis involved in the solution provides some interesting results,
such as upper/lower bounds on the size of the released alphabet and the maximum
utility. Afterwards, it is shown that for the jointly Gaussian $(X,Y)$, perfect
privacy is not possible in the output perturbation model in contrast to the
full data observation model. Finally, an asymptotic analysis is provided to
obtain the rate of released information when a sufficiently small leakage is
allowed. In particular, in the context of output perturbation model, it is
shown that this rate is always finite when perfect privacy is not feasible, and
two lower bounds are provided for it; When perfect privacy is feasible, it is
shown that under mild conditions, this rate becomes unbounded.

microscopy to investigate temperature-dependent phenomena such as
self-assembly, diffusio- or thermophoresis, or crystal growth. Several hurdles
must be solved to develop a temperature-controlled stage for laser scanning
confocal microscopy, in particular regarding the influence of an elevated
temperature gradient close to the microscope objective, which most people try
very hard to avoid. Here we report the design of a temperature-controlled stage
able to generate stable temperature gradients in both positive and negative
temperature range and does not require use of liquid nitrogen. Our setup
provides an excellent control of the temperature gradient, which can be coupled
with a controlled displacement of the sample, making it useful in particular
for a variety of solidification, chemistry, and interfacial problems. We
illustrate the benefits of our setup with several case studies of interest in
chemistry and materials science: the 3D real-time imaging of ice growth, the
segregation of hard particles by growing crystals, the freezing behaviour of
single emulsions, the self-shaping of oil droplets upon cooling, and the
self-assembly of amphiphile molecules into helical structures. These results
show how confocal microscopy coupled with a temperature-controlled stage is a
welcome addition to the toolkit of chemists and materials scientists.

  Fortifying existing protected-module architectures in a real-world setting

detect the most novel attacks, suffer from false-positives, and place an
extraordinary heavy burden on enclave-developers when an attack is detected.
  We present Heisenberg, a proactive defense that provides complete protection

either be prevented or detected automatically before {\em any} sensitive
information leaks. Consequently, Heisenberg can always securely resume enclave
execution -- even when the attacker is still present in the system.
  We present two implementations. Heisenberg-HW relies on very limited hardware
features to defend against page-table-based attacks. We use the x86/SGX

protected-module architectures are ported to different platforms as well.
  Heisenberg-SW avoids these hardware modifications and can readily be applied.

distributed avalanches of local rupture events whereby microcracks nucleate and
grow, which are also observed in for an elastic interface evolving in a
non-homogeneous medium. For this reason, it is tempting to relate failure to
the depinning of an elastic interface. Here we compute the elastic kernel of
the interface representing the damage field of a brittle solid. In the case of
a damage model of rupture under compression, which implements the Mohr-Coulomb
criterion at the local scale, we show that the elastic kernel is unstable, and
hence is very different from the kernels of usual interfaces. We show that the
unstable modes are responsible for the localization of damage along a
macroscopic fault observed in numerical simulations. At low disorder, the most
unstable mode gives the orientation of the macroscopic fault that we measure in
numerical simulations. The orientation of the fault changes when the level of
disorder is increased, suggesting a complex interplay of the unstable modes and

parity-check (LDPC)-like code with an underlying sparse decoding graph. This
sparse graph is based on the encoding factor graph of polar codes and is
suitable for conventional belief propagation (BP) decoding. We discuss several
pruning techniques based on the check node decoder (CND) and variable node
decoder (VND) update equations, significantly reducing the size (i.e., decoding
complexity) of the parity-check matrix. As a result, iterative polar decoding
can then be conducted on a sparse graph, akin to the traditional
well-established LDPC decoding, e.g., using a fully parallel sum-product
algorithm (SPA). This facilitates the systematic analysis and design of polar
codes using the well-established tools known from analyzing LDPC codes. We show
that the proposed iterative polar decoder has a negligible performance loss for
short-to-intermediate codelengths compared to Arikan's original BP decoder.
Finally, the proposed decoder is shown to benefit from both reduced complexity
and reduced memory requirements and, thus, is more suitable for hardware
implementations.

Using the same principles of entropic inference that underlie the foundations
of information theory and statistical thermodynamics, and also enjoy fruitful
application in image processing, spectral analysis, machine learning,
econometrics, bioinformatics, and a growing number of other fields, we motivate
and explore a method for Congressional apportionment based on minimizing
relative entropy (also known as Kullback-Leibler divergence), or, equivalently,
maximizing Shannon entropy. In terms of communication theory, we might say that
the entropic apportionment gives each constituent as equal a voice as possible.
If we view representational weight as a finite resource to be distributed
amongst the represented population, the entropic measure is identical with the
Theil index long employed in economics to measure inequality in the
distribution of wealth or income, or in ecology to measure the distribution of
biomass or reproductive fitness. Besides Congressional apportionment, the
method is also directly applicable to other multi-regional or
multi-constituency legislatures, to party-list proportional voting systems used
in various parliamentary elections, and similar settings, where the task is to
allocate a discrete number of seats or other resources, and the primary goal is
one of maximal proportionality or equity. In addition, the same entropic
figure-of-merit can be used in parallel to compare different choices for the
total number of representatives, and then subsequently to assess different
Congressional district sizes, after seats are assigned and proposed district
boundaries drawn.

the deviation in color across the UV to near-IR for dE's is a strong signal of

  influential journey",,,,,"physics.pop-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Based on several recent developments in relativistic astrophysics and
observational cosmology, this article discusses prospects of (1) theoretical
structure of General Relativity (GR) in the new era and (2) submission of GR to
new and previously unanticipated tests. It explores the internal theoretical
challenges experienced by the theory and challenges produced by it in the
otherwise successful journey of 100 years. Gravitational collapse,
geometrization of laws of physics, absence of strong field astronomical tests,
the dark components of the universe (Cold Dark Matter (CDM) + Cosmological
Constant ($\Lambda$ ) or something similar) and cosmological inflation have not
only created serious challenges for the theory but also have ignited
contemplation for alternatives and attempts for constraining them through
observations. The article first explains the nature of the theory and how it
was perceived by scientific community a century ago. It then highlights certain
perspectives from cosmology and quantum gravity, the ultimate applications of
the theory. With the advent of modern observing techniques, the theory has been
experiencing tug of war with several tests. Our true journey with the theory
has started only recently, thanks to the development of gravitational wave
astronomy and extremely large telescopes some of which are and will be
dedicated to test the theory by exploring previously uncharted regions of the
universe. Incorporating several aspects of observational astronomy and
cosmology, gravitational wave research and theoretical physics the article
presents the new challenges created by the theory and also their prospects.

thin film flow equations using moving mesh refinement. The moving mesh strategy
is based on harmonic mappings developed by Li et al. [J. Comput. Phys., 170
(2001), pp. 562-588, and 177 (2002), pp. 365-393]. To achieve a high quality
mesh, we adopt an adaptive monitor function and smooth it based on a diffusive
mechanism. A variety of numerical tests are performed to demonstrate the
accuracy and efficiency of the method. The moving mesh refinement accurately
resolves the overshoot and downshoot structures and reduces the computational
cost in comparison to numerical simulations using a fixed mesh.

  Juvenile Locusts",,,,,"q-bio.NC cs.CV cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For autonomous robots in dynamic environments mixed with human, it is vital
to detect impending collision quickly and robustly. The biological visual
systems evolved over millions of years may provide us efficient solutions for
collision detection in complex environments. In the cockpit of locusts, two
Lobula Giant Movement Detectors, i.e. LGMD1 and LGMD2, have been identified
which respond to looming objects rigorously with high firing rates. Compared to
LGMD1, LGMD2 matures early in the juvenile locusts with specific selectivity to
dark moving objects against bright background in depth while not responding to
light objects embedded in dark background - a similar situation which ground
vehicles and robots are facing with. However, little work has been done on
modeling LGMD2, let alone its potential in robotics and other vision-based
applications. In this article, we propose a novel way of modeling LGMD2 neuron,
with biased ON and OFF pathways splitting visual streams into parallel channels
encoding brightness increments and decrements separately to fulfill its
selectivity. Moreover, we apply a biophysical mechanism of spike frequency
adaptation to shape the looming selectivity in such a collision-detecting
neuron model. The proposed visual neural network has been tested with
systematic experiments, challenged against synthetic and real physical stimuli,
as well as image streams from the sensor of a miniature robot. The results
demonstrated this framework is able to detect looming dark objects embedded in
bright backgrounds selectively, which make it ideal for ground mobile
platforms. The robotic experiments also showed its robustness in collision
detection - it performed well for near range navigation in an arena with many
obstacles. Its enhanced collision selectivity to dark approaching objects
versus receding and translating ones has also been verified via systematic
experiments.

paramount model of the non-equilibrium critical behavior is the directed bond
percolation process that exhibits an active- to-absorbing state phase
transition in the vicinity of a percolation threshold. Fluctuations of the
ambient environment might affect or destroy the universality properties
completely. In this work we assume that the random environment can be described
by means of compressible velocity fluctu- ations. Using field-theoretic models
and renormalization group methods we investigate large-scale and long-time
behavior. Altogether eleven universality classes are found, out of which four
are stable in the infrared limit and thus macroscopically accessible. In
contrast to the model without veloc- ity fluctuations a possible candidate for
a realistic three-dimensional case, a regime with relevant short-range noise,
is identified. Depending on the dimensionality of space and the structure of
the turbulent flow we calculate critical exponents of the directed percolation
process. In the limit of the purely transversal velocity field random force
critical exponents comply with the incompressible results obtained by previous
authors. We have found intriguing non-universal behavior related to the mutual
effect of compressibility and advection.
