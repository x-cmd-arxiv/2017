rank 17. While the Picard number of a generic K3 surface in such moduli space
is 19, the Picard number is enhanced to 20 at special points in the moduli. K3
surfaces become attractive K3 surfaces at these points. Either of the following
two situations occurs at such special points: i) the Mordell-Weil rank of an
elliptic K3 surface is enhanced, or ii) the gauge symmetry is enhanced. The
first case i) is related to the appearance of a $U(1)$ gauge symmetry. In this
note, we construct the moduli of K3 surfaces with $ADE$ types $E_7 D_{10}$ and
$A_{17}$. We determine some of the special points at which K3 surfaces become
attractive in the moduli of K3 surfaces with $ADE$ types $E_7 D_{10}$ and
$A_{17}$. We investigate the gauge symmetries in F-theory compactifications on
attractive K3 surfaces which correspond to such special points in the moduli

favorable delay performance in large-scale systems, and yet only require
minimal implementation overhead. Aimed at a broad audience, the paper starts
with an introduction to the basic load balancing scenario, consisting of a
single dispatcher where tasks arrive that must immediately be forwarded to one
of $N$ single-server queues.
  A popular class of load balancing algorithms are so-called power-of-$d$ or
JSQ($d$) policies, where an incoming task is assigned to a server with the
shortest queue among $d$ servers selected uniformly at random. This class
includes the Join-the-Shortest-Queue (JSQ) policy as a special case ($d = N$),
which has strong stochastic optimality properties and yields a mean waiting
time that vanishes as $N$ grows large for any fixed subcritical load. However,
a nominal implementation of the JSQ policy involves a prohibitive communication
burden in large-scale deployments. In contrast, a random assignment policy ($d
= 1$) does not entail any communication overhead, but the mean waiting time
remains constant as $N$ grows large for any fixed positive load.
  In order to examine the fundamental trade-off between performance and
implementation overhead, we consider an asymptotic regime where $d(N)$ depends
on $N$. We investigate what growth rate of $d(N)$ is required to match the
performance of the JSQ policy on fluid and diffusion scale. The results
demonstrate that the asymptotics for the JSQ($d(N)$) policy are insensitive to
the exact growth rate of $d(N)$, as long as the latter is sufficiently fast,
implying that the optimality of the JSQ policy can asymptotically be preserved
while dramatically reducing the communication overhead. We additionally show
how the communication overhead can be reduced yet further by the so-called
Join-the-Idle-Queue scheme, leveraging memory at the dispatcher.

`98) to give the first sublinear time algorithm for the c-approximate nearest
neighbor (ANN) problem using only polynomial space. At a high level, an LSH
family hashes ""nearby"" points to the same bucket and ""far away"" points to
different buckets. The quality of measure of an LSH family is its LSH exponent,
which helps determine both query time and space usage.
  In a seminal work, Andoni and Indyk (FOCS `06) constructed an LSH family
based on random ball partitioning of space that achieves an LSH exponent of
1/c^2 for the l_2 norm, which was later shown to be optimal by Motwani, Naor
and Panigrahy (SIDMA `07) and O'Donnell, Wu and Zhou (TOCT `14). Although
optimal in the LSH exponent, the ball partitioning approach is computationally
expensive. So, in the same work, Andoni and Indyk proposed a simpler and more
practical hashing scheme based on Euclidean lattices and provided computational
results using the 24-dimensional Leech lattice. However, no theoretical
analysis of the scheme was given, thus leaving open the question of finding the
exponent of lattice based LSH.
  In this work, we resolve this question by showing the existence of lattices
achieving the optimal LSH exponent of 1/c^2 using techniques from the geometry
of numbers. At a more conceptual level, our results show that optimal LSH space
partitions can have periodic structure. Understanding the extent to which
additional structure can be imposed on these partitions, e.g. to yield low
space and query complexity, remains an important open problem.

linearly reproduce the numerical solution of the boundary value problem over

first derivative. The constructed difference scheme give a highly effective
tool for solving problems with a small parameter at the older derivative in a

with maximum regularity. When implemented following the paradigms of classical
finite element methods, the computational resources required by the $k-$method
are prohibitive even for moderate degree. In order to address this issue, we
propose a matrix-free strategy combined with weighted quadrature, which is an
ad-hoc strategy to compute the integrals of the Galerkin system. Matrix-free
weighted quadrature (MF-WQ) speeds up matrix operations, and, perhaps even more
important, greatly reduces memory consumption. Our strategy also requires an
efficient preconditioner for the linear system iterative solver. In this work
we deal with an elliptic model problem, and adopt a preconditioner based on the
Fast Diagonalization method, an old idea to solve Sylvester-like equations. Our
numerical tests show that the isogeometric solver based on MF-WQ is faster than
standard approaches (where the main cost is the matrix formation by standard
Gaussian quadrature) even for low degree. But the main achievement is that,
with MF-WQ, the $k$-method gets orders of magnitude faster by increasing the
degree, given a target accuracy. Therefore, we are able to show the
superiority, in terms of computational efficiency, of the high-degree
$k$-method with respect to low-degree isogeometric discretizations. What we
present here is applicable to more complex and realistic differential problems,
but its effectiveness will depend on the preconditioner stage, which is as
always problem-dependent. This situation is typical of modern high-order
methods: the overall performance is mainly related to the quality of the
preconditioner.

population. A crucial issue when adjusting such a model to data consists in
identifying fixed and random effects. From a statistical point of view, it
remains to test the nullity of the variances of a given subset of random
effects. Some authors have proposed to use the likelihood ratio test and have
established its asymptotic distribution in some particular cases. Nevertheless,
to the best of our knowledge, no general variance components testing procedure
has been fully investigated yet. In this paper, we study the likelihood ratio
test properties to test that the variances of a general subset of the random
effects are equal to zero in both linear and nonlinear mixed effects model,
extending the existing results. We prove that the asymptotic distribution of
the test is a chi-bar-square distribution, that is to say a mixture of
chi-square distributions, and we identify the corresponding weights. We
highlight in particular that the limiting distribution depends on the presence
of correlations between the random effects but not on the linear or nonlinear
structure of the mixed effects model. We illustrate the finite sample size
properties of the test procedure through simulation studies and apply the test
procedure to two real datasets of dental growth and of coucal growth.

the wave distortions in scattering layers can be characterized with only the
phase of the optical-transfer-function (OTF, the Fourier transform of PSF),
with which diffraction-limit images can be analytically solved. We then develop
a method that exploits the redundant information dynamic objects, and can
reliably and rapidly recover OTFs' phases within several iterations. It enables
not only noninvasive video imaging at 25 ~ 200 Hz of a moving object hidden
inside turbid media, but also imaging under weak illumination that is
inaccessible with previous methods. Furthermore, by scanning a localized
illumination on the object plane, we propose a wide-field imaging approach,

quantum nature of light, there is an inherent uncertainty in the determinations
of the particle's position and momentum dictated by an indeterminacy relation,
$\delta q \delta p \sim h$. Heisenberg offered this demonstration as ""a direct
physical interpretation of the [quantum mechanical] equation $\textbf{pq} -

of the statistical character of quantum mechanics. In addition, Heisenberg
hoped but was unable to demonstrate that the laws of quantum mechanics could be

of Light Emitting Diode and Photodiode from any part of the body. With IoT and
smart homes' penetration, PPG recording can easily be integrated with other
vital wearable devices. PPG represents peculiarity of hemodynamics and
cardiovascular system for each individual. This paper presents non-fiducial
method for PPG based biometric authentication. Being a physiological signal,
PPG signal alters with physical/mental stress and time. For robustness, these
variations cannot be ignored. While, most of the previous works focused only on
single session, this paper demonstrates extensive performance evaluation of PPG
biometrics against single session data, different emotions, physical exercise
and time-lapse using Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and Direct Linear
Discriminant Analysis (DLDA). When evaluated on different states and datasets,
equal error rate (EER) of $0.5\%$-$6\%$ was achieved for $45$-$60$s average
training time. Our CWT/DLDA based technique outperformed all other
dimensionality reduction techniques and previous work.

in a unified, system-level view the technical and non-technical aspects. We

measured by the concurrence. We perform an analysis for four qubits, showing
that such a state indeed exists. To this end we analyze specific states of four
qubits that are not convexly balanced as for $SL$ invariant families of
entanglement, but only affinely balanced. For these states all possible

they will possess at least a certain unitary invariant.

reached in the rank-two case of a homogeneous polynomial $SL$-invariant measure
of entanglement of degree $2m$, if there is a state which corresponds to a
maximally $m$-fold degenerate solution in the zero-polytope that can be
combined with the convexified minimal characteristic curve to give a

into account the gravity gradient torque and the torque due to eddy currents

underlying the senses of hearing and balance. The key players involved in this
process are mechanosensitive ion channels. They are located in the stereocilia
of hair cells and opened by the tension in specialized molecular springs, the
tip links, connecting adjacent stereocilia. When channels open, the tip links
relax, reducing the hair-bundle stiffness. This gating compliance makes hair
cells especially sensitive to small stimuli. The classical explanation for the
gating compliance is that the conformational rearrangement of a single channel
directly shortens the tip link. However, to reconcile theoretical models based
on this mechanism with experimental data, an unrealistically large structural
change of the channel is required. Experimental evidence indicates that each
tip link is a dimeric molecule, associated on average with two channels at its
lower end. It also indicates that the lipid bilayer modulates channel gating,
although it is not clear how. Here, we design and analyze a model of
mechanotransduction where each tip link attaches to two channels, mobile within
the membrane. Their states and positions are coupled by membrane-mediated
elastic forces arising from the interaction between the channels' hydrophobic
cores and that of the lipid bilayer. This coupling induces cooperative opening
and closing of the channels. The model reproduces the main properties of
hair-cell mechanotransduction using only realistic parameters constrained by
experimental evidence. This work provides an insight into the fundamental role
that membrane-mediated ion-channel cooperativity can play in sensory
physiology.

working in linearized gravity and at leading orders in the orbital velocity,
but to all orders in the black holes' spins. Though the spins are treated
nonperturbatively, surprisingly, the binding energy and the flux are given by
simple analytical expressions which are finite (respectively third- and
fifth-order) polynomials in the spins. Our final results are restricted to the
important case of quasi-circular orbits with the black holes' spins aligned
with the orbital angular momentum.

"1712.08604","Aneeq Zia","Aneeq Zia, Irfan Essa","Automated Surgical Skill Assessment in RMIS Training","Accepted at IPCAI 2018",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: Manual feedback in basic RMIS training can consume a significant
amount of time from expert surgeons' schedule and is prone to subjectivity.
While VR-based training tasks can generate automated score reports, there is no
mechanism of generating automated feedback for surgeons performing basic
surgical tasks in RMIS training. In this paper, we explore the usage of
different holistic features for automated skill assessment using only robot
kinematic data and propose a weighted feature fusion technique for improving
score prediction performance.
  Methods: We perform our experiments on the publicly available JIGSAWS dataset
and evaluate four different types of holistic features from robot kinematic
data - Sequential Motion Texture (SMT), Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT),
Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Approximate Entropy (ApEn). The features
are then used for skill classification and exact skill score prediction. Along
with using these features individually, we also evaluate the performance using
our proposed weighted combination technique.
  Results: Our results demonstrate that these holistic features outperform all
previous HMM based state-of-the-art methods for skill classification on the
JIGSAWS dataset. Also, our proposed feature fusion strategy significantly
improves performance for skill score predictions achieving up to 0.61 average
spearman correlation coefficient.
  Conclusions: Holistic features capturing global information from robot
kinematic data can successfully be used for evaluating surgeon skill in basic
surgical tasks on the da Vinci robot. Using the framework presented can
potentially allow for real time score feedback in RMIS training.

vorticity and weak solutions with vortex sheets/entropy waves for the steady
Euler equations for both compressible and incompressible fluids in arbitrary
infinitely long nozzles. We first develop a new approach to establish the
existence of smooth solutions without assumptions on the sign of the second
derivatives of the horizontal velocity, or the Bernoulli and entropy functions,
at the inlet for the smooth case. Then the existence for the smooth case can be
applied to construct approximate solutions to establish the existence of weak
solutions with vortex sheets/entropy waves by nonlinear arguments. This is the
first result on the global existence of solutions of the multidimensional
steady compressible full Euler equations with free boundaries, which are not
necessarily small perturbations of piecewise constant background solutions. The
subsonic-sonic limit of the solutions is also shown. Finally, through the
incompressible limit, we establish the existence and uniqueness of
incompressible Euler flows in arbitrary infinitely long nozzles for both the
smooth solutions with large vorticity and the weak solutions with vortex
sheets. The methods and techniques developed here will be useful for solving
other problems involving similar difficulties.

interactions in liquid xenon at energies below 50 keV, which are relevant for
rare event searches using xenon as target material. Here we describe in detail
the detector, its associated infrastructure, and the signal identification
algorithm developed for processing and analysing the data. We present the first
characterisation of the new instrument with calibration data from an internal
83m-Kr source. The zero-field light yield is 15.0 and 14.0 photoelectrons/keV
at 9.4 keV and 32.1 keV, respectively, and the corresponding values at an
electron drift field of 1 kV/cm are 10.8 and 7.9 photoelectrons/keV. The charge
yields at these energies are 28 and 31 electrons/keV, with the proportional
scintillation yield of 24 photoelectrons per one electron extracted into the
gas phase, and an electron lifetime of 200 $\mu$s. The relative energy
resolution, $\sigma/E$, is 11.9 % and 5.8 % at 9.4 keV and 32.1 keV,

time. In order for learning to occur, non-local information must be
communicated to the deep synapses through a communication channel, the deep
learning channel. We identify several possible architectures for this learning
channel (Bidirectional, Conjoined, Twin, Distinct) and six symmetry challenges:
1) symmetry of architectures; 2) symmetry of weights; 3) symmetry of neurons;
4) symmetry of derivatives; 5) symmetry of processing; and 6) symmetry of
learning rules. Random backpropagation (RBP) addresses the second and third
symmetry, and some of its variations, such as skipped RBP (SRBP) address the
first and the fourth symmetry. Here we address the last two desirable
symmetries showing through simulations that they can be achieved and that the
learning channel is particularly robust to symmetry variations. Specifically,
random backpropagation and its variations can be performed with the same
non-linear neurons used in the main input-output forward channel, and the
connections in the learning channel can be adapted using the same algorithm
used in the forward channel, removing the need for any specialized hardware in
the learning channel. Finally, we provide mathematical results in simple cases
showing that the learning equations in the forward and backward channels
converge to fixed points, for almost any initial conditions. In symmetric
architectures, if the weights in both channels are small at initialization,
adaptation in both channels leads to weights that are essentially symmetric
during and after learning. Biological connections are discussed.

peculiar velocities. The signals from groups of different mass are constrained
simultaneously to take care of projection effects of nearby halos. The total
kSZE flux within halos estimated implies that the gas fraction in halos is
about the universal baryon fraction, even in low-mass halos, indicating that
the `missing baryons' are found. Various tests performed show that our results
are robust against systematic effects, such as contamination by infrared/radio

halo exteriors. Combined with the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, our
results indicate that the `missing baryons' associated with galaxy groups are
contained in warm-hot media with temperatures between $10^5$ and $10^6\,{\rm

known, which we call a calibration training set, and (3) a calibration method
for using the approximate probability estimates and the calibration training
set to generate calibrated probabilities for the many remaining pairs of
variables. We also introduce a new calibration method based on a shallow neural
network. Our experiments on simulated data support that the proposed approach
improves the calibration of causal edge predictions. The results also support
that the approach often improves the precision and recall of predictions.

is the statement that the space of operators that commute with the tensor
powers of all unitaries is spanned by the permutations of the tensor factors.
In this work, we describe a similar duality theory for tensor powers of
Clifford unitaries. The Clifford group is a central object in many subfields of
quantum information, most prominently in the theory of fault-tolerance. The
duality theory has a simple and clean description in terms of finite
geometries. We demonstrate its effectiveness in several applications:
  (1) We resolve an open problem in quantum property testing by showing that
""stabilizerness"" is efficiently testable: There is a protocol that, given
access to six copies of an unknown state, can determine whether it is a
stabilizer state, or whether it is far away from the set of stabilizer states.
We give a related membership test for the Clifford group.
  (2) We find that tensor powers of stabilizer states have an increased
symmetry group. We provide corresponding de Finetti theorems, showing that the
reductions of arbitrary states with this symmetry are well-approximated by
mixtures of stabilizer tensor powers (in some cases, exponentially well).
  (3) We show that the distance of a pure state to the set of stabilizers can
be lower-bounded in terms of the sum-negativity of its Wigner function. This
gives a new quantitative meaning to the sum-negativity (and the related mana)
-- a measure relevant to fault-tolerant quantum computation. The result
constitutes a robust generalization of the discrete Hudson theorem.
  (4) We show that complex projective designs of arbitrary order can be
obtained from a finite number (independent of the number of qudits) of Clifford
orbits. To prove this result, we give explicit formulas for arbitrary moments
of random stabilizer states.

suggesting that Mendeley readership can reliably inform the analysis of these

quantum field theory. The extension to an arbitrary even charge is
straightforward. The generalization of these abelian theories to $SO(N)$ gauge

surprising non-abelian symmetry involving time-reversal.

accomplished via scattering of light between different optical modes, mediated

the fundamental point of view at an ultra-violat completed theory, they can be
light if they are realized as pseudo-Goldstone bosons of some spontaneously
broken global symmetries. The spontaneous breaking scale is parametrized by the
decay constant $f$. The global symmetry is defined by the lowest order terms
allowed in the effective theory consistent with the gauge symmetry in question.
Since any global symmetry is known to be broken at least by quantum
gravitational effects, all pseudoscalars should be massive. The mass scale is
determined by $f$ and the explicit breaking terms $\Delta V$ in the effective
potential and also anomaly terms $\Delta\Lambda^4_G$ for some non-Abelian gauge
groups $G$. The well-known example by non-Abelian gauge group breaking is the
potential for the ""invisible"" QCD axion, via the Peccei-Quinn symmetry, which
constitutes a major part of this review. Even if there is no breaking terms
from gauge anomalies, there can be explicit breaking terms $\Delta V$ in the
potential in which case the leading term suppressed by $f$ determines the
pseudoscalar mass scale. If the breaking term is extremely small and the decay
constant is trans-Planckian, the corresponding pseudoscalar can be a candidate
for a `quintessential axion'. In general, $(\Delta V)^{1/4}$ is considered to
be smaller than $f$, and hence the pseudo-Goldstone boson mass scales are
considered to be smaller than the decay constants. In such a case, the
potential of the pseudo-Goldstone boson at the grand unification scale is
sufficiently flat near the top of the potential that it can be a good candidate
for an inflationary model, which is known as `natural inflation'. We review all
these ideas in the bosonic collective motion framework.

clusters (d), loops (e) and boundary segments (f) in a Neumann boundary

weight ($\beta = 0$), we find determinant and pfaffian expressions for these

$\tfrac \theta \pi (1+ \tfrac{2\theta}\pi)$, where $\theta$ encodes the weight
of one class of loops for the correlator of type f. These results are obtained
by analysing the asymptotics of the exact expressions, and by using the
Cardy-Peschel formula in the case where $x$ and $y$ are set to the corners. For
type b, we find a $\ln|x-y|$ dependence from the asymptotics, and a $\ln (\ln

of the boundary condition of type b as the insertion of a logarithmic field

kinetic structure of steady-state, planar plasma shocks, e.g., the shock width
scaling by Mach number, $M$. However, it did not discuss shock-driven
ion-species stratification (e.g., relative concentration modification, and
temperature separation). These are important effects, since many recent ICF
experiments have evaded explanation by standard, single-fluid,
radiation-hydrodynamic (rad-hydro) numerical simulations, and shock-driven fuel
stratification likely contributes to this discrepancy. Employing the
state-of-the-art Vlasov-Fokker-Planck code, iFP, along with multi-ion hydro
simulations and semi-analytics, we quantify the ion stratification by planar
shocks with arbitrary Mach number and relative species concentration for
two-ion plasmas in terms of ion mass and charge ratios. In particular, for
strong shocks, we find that the structure of the ion temperature separation has
a nearly universal character across ion mass and charge ratios. Additionally,
we find that the shock fronts are enriched with the lighter ion species, and
the enrichment scales as $M^4$ for $M \gg 1$.

solutions of continuous-time linear state space models is equivalent to the
class of cointegrated continuous-time ARMA (MCARMA) processes. As a start, some
pseudo-innovations are constructed to be able to define a QML-function.
Moreover, the parameter vector is divided appropriately in long-run and
short-run parameters using a representation for cointegrated solutions of
continuous-time linear state space models as a sum of a L\'evy process plus a
stationary solution of a linear state space model. Then, we establish the
consistency of our estimator in three steps. First, we show the consistency for
the QML estimator of the long-run parameters. In the next step, we calculate
its consistency rate. Finally, we use these results to prove the consistency

asymptotically mixed normally distributed, whereas the short-run parameters are

Departing from well-understood approaches inspired by OpenFlow, WNOS provides
the network designer with an abstraction hiding (i) the lower-level details of
the wireless protocol stack and (ii) the distributed nature of the network
operations. Based on this abstract representation, the WNOS takes network
control programs written on a centralized, high-level view of the network and
automatically generates distributed cross-layer control programs based on
distributed optimization theory that are executed by each individual node on an
abstract representation of the radio hardware.
  We first discuss the main architectural principles of WNOS. Then, we discuss
a new approach to generate solution algorithms for each of the resulting
subproblems in an automated fashion. Finally, we illustrate a prototype
implementation of WNOS on software-defined radio devices and test its
effectiveness by considering specific cross-layer control problems.
Experimental results indicate that, based on the automatically generated
distributed control programs, WNOS achieves 18%, 56% and 80.4% utility gain in
networks with low, medium and high levels of interference; maybe more
importantly, we illustrate how the global network behavior can be controlled by
modifying a few lines of code on a centralized abstraction.

Fitting such models usually heavily relies on the properties of stationarity,
ergodicity, and orderliness. And, though processes based on negative binomial
finite dimensional distributions have been widely considered, they typically
fail to simultaneously satisfy the three required properties for fitting.
Indeed, it has been conjectured by Diggle and Milne that no negative binomial

shown to possess all required properties, and additionally span the negative

actors are known to star in movies, and scientists are known for their academic

triples our experiments based on this approach result in an accuracy equal to

provided that superconducting radio-frequency cavities in fact possess high
quality factors for both electromagnetic and gravitational microwave radiation,
as one would expect due to a quantum-mechanical gravitational Meissner-like
effect. In order to characterize the response of matter to tensor gravitational
fields, we introduce a prefactor to the source term of the gravitational wave
equation, which we call the ""relative gravitational permeativity"" analogous to
the ""relative electric permittivity"" and ""relative magnetic permeability"" that
characterize the vector response of matter to applied fields in
electromagnetism. This allows for a possibly large quantum mechanical
enhancement of the response of a superconductor to an incident tensor
gravitational wave field. Finally, we describe our experimental work with
high-Q superconducting radio-frequency cavities, and propose a design for a
coupled-cavity system with a flexible superconducting membrane in its middle as

for discrete quantum groups. After introducing a notion of residual finiteness,
we show that it implies the Kirchberg factorization property for the discrete
quantum group in question. We also prove the analogue of Kirchberg's theorem,
to the effect that conversely, the factorization property and property (T)
jointly imply residual finiteness. We also apply these results to certain
classes of discrete quantum groups obtained by means of bicrossed product
constructions and study the preservation of the properties (factorization,
residual finiteness, property (T)) under extensions of discrete quantum groups.

Yang-Mills theory coupled to a biadjoint scalar field admits a radiative double
copy that agrees with solutions in Einstein-Yang-Mills theory at the lowest
finite order. Within this context, the trace-reversed metric $\bar{h}^{\mu\nu}$
is a natural double copy of the gauge boson $A^{\mu a}$. This work provides
additional evidence that solutions in gauge and gravity theories are related,
even though their respective Lagrangians and nonlinear equations of motion

e.g., purchases by retail customers. Many machine learning applications employ
neighborhood-based measures to characterize the similarity among the nodes,
such as the pairwise number of common neighbors (CN) and related metrics. While
the number of node pairs that share neighbors is potentially enormous, only a
relatively small proportion of them have many common neighbors. This motivates
finding a weighted sampling approach to preferentially sample these node pairs.
This paper presents a new sampling algorithm that provides a fixed size
unbiased estimate of the similarity matrix resulting from a bipartite graph
stream projection. The algorithm has two components. First, it maintains a
reservoir of sampled bipartite edges with sampling weights that favor selection
of high similarity nodes. Second, arriving edges generate a stream of
\textsl{similarity updates} based on their adjacency with the current sample.
These updates are aggregated in a second reservoir sample-based stream
aggregator to yield the final unbiased estimate. Experiments on real world
graphs show that a 10% sample at each stage yields estimates of high similarity
edges with weighted relative errors of about 1%.

equations over $R$, in several variables, with solutions in $R$. We view $HTP$
as an operator, mapping each set $W$ of prime numbers to $HTP(\mathbb
Z[W^{-1}])$, which is naturally viewed as a set of polynomials in $\mathbb

Davis, Putnam, and Robinson that the jump $\emptyset~\!'$ is Turing-equivalent
to $HTP(\mathbb Z)$. More generally, $HTP(\mathbb Z[W^{-1}])$ is always
Turing-reducible to $W'$, but not necessarily equivalent. We show here that the
situation with $W=\emptyset$ is anomalous: for almost all $W$, the jump $W'$ is
not diophantine in $\mathbb Z[W^{-1}]$. We also show that the $HTP$ operator
does not preserve Turing equivalence: even for complementary sets $U$ and
$\overline{U}$, $HTP(\mathbb Z[U^{-1}])$ and $HTP(\mathbb

also possible, with $V<_T W$ but $HTP(\mathbb Z[W^{-1}]) <_T HTP(\mathbb

nonlinear perturbative orders in the expansion of the density field at large
scales in the matter dominated era. General Relativity is an intrinsically
nonlinear theory, establishing a nonlinear relation between the metric and the
density field. Representing the metric perturbations with the curvature
perturbation zeta, it is known that nonlinearity produces effective
non-Gaussian terms in the nonlinear perturbations of the matter density field,
even if the primordial zeta is Gaussian. Here we generalise these results to
the case of a non-Gaussian primordial zeta. Using a standard parametrization of
primordial non-Gaussianity in zeta in terms of fNL, gNL, hNL..., we show how at
higher order (from third and higher) nonlinearity also produces a mixing of
these contributions to the density field at large scales, e.g. both fNL and gNL
contribute to the third order in the density contrast. This is the main result
of this paper. Our analysis is based on the synergy between a gradient
expansion (aka long-wavelength approximation) and standard perturbation theory
at higher order. In essence, mathematically the equations for the gradient
expansion are equivalent to those of first order perturbation theory, thus
first-order results convert into gradient expansion results and, vice versa,
the gradient expansion can be used to derive results in perturbation theory at
higher order and large scales.

receiver's energy consumption and computational complexity, 1-bit
analog-to-digital converters are used in the front-end. The performance loss
due to the 1-bit quantization can be mitigated by using large-scale antenna
arrays. We propose a linear low-resolution-aware minimum mean square error
detector for soft multiuser interference mitigation. Moreover, short block
length low-density parity-check codes are considered for avoiding high latency.
In the channel decoder, a quasi-uniform quantizer with scaling factors is

factor two or three. A usual test of the many-body calculations is the
comparison to several nuclear observables, but so far no nuclear structure

robust across $pf$-shell nuclei.

method for computing epigenetic landscapes and phenotype-transitions in
metastable gene networks. Our computational pipeline was inspired by studies of
metastability and barrier-crossing in protein folding, and provides an
automated means of computing and visualizing essential stationary and dynamic
information that is generally inaccessible to conventional simulation. Applied
to a network model of pluripotency in Embryonic Stem Cells, our simulations
revealed rare phenotypes and approximately Markovian transitions among
phenotype-states, occurring with a broad range of timescales. The relative
probabilities of phenotypes and the transition paths linking pluripotency and
differentiation are sensitive to global kinetic parameters governing
transcription factor-DNA binding kinetics. Our approach significantly expands
the capability of stochastic simulation to investigate gene regulatory network

  Multiuser Channel",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A broadcast strategy for multiple access communication over slowly fading
channels is introduced, in which the channel state information is known to only
the receiver. In this strategy, the transmitters split their information
streams into multiple independent information streams, each adapted to a
specific actual channel realization. The major distinction between the proposed
strategy and the existing ones is that in the existing approaches, each
transmitter adapts its transmission strategy only to the fading process of its
direct channel to the receiver, hence directly adopting a single-user strategy
previously designed for the single-user channels. However, the contribution of
each user to a network-wide measure (e.g., sum-rate capacity) depends not only
on the user's direct channel to the receiver, but also on the qualities of
other channels. Driven by this premise, this paper proposes an alternative
broadcast strategy in which the transmitters adapt their transmissions to the
combined states resulting from all users' channels. This leads to generating a
larger number of information streams by each transmitter and adopting a
different decoding strategy by the receiver. An achievable rate region and an
outer bound that capture the trade-off among the rates of different information
layers are established, and it is shown that the achievable rate region
subsumes the existing known capacity regions obtained based on adapting the
broadcast approach to the single-user channels.

ordinary strings in the $p \to 1$ limit. Previously, we established that
$p$-adic Koba-Nielsen string amplitudes are finite sums of multivariate Igusa's
local zeta functions, consequently, they are convergent integrals that admit
meromorphic continuations as rational functions. The meromorphic continuation
of local zeta functions has been used for several authors to regularize
parametric Feynman amplitudes in field and string theories. Denef and Loeser
established that the limit $p \to 1$ of a Igusa's local zeta function gives
rise to an object called topological zeta function. By using Denef-Loeser's
theory of topological zeta functions, we show that limit $p \to 1$ of
tree-level $p$-adic string amplitudes give rise to certain amplitudes, that we
have named Denef-Loeser string amplitudes. Gerasimov and Shatashvili showed
that in limit $p \to 1$ the well-known non-local effective Lagrangian
(reproducing the tree-level $p$-adic string amplitudes) gives rise to a simple
Lagrangian with a logarithmic potential. We show that the Feynman amplitudes of

orientation and the components of the quantum geometric tensor (QGT): the
metric tensor and the Berry curvature. We show how the k-dependent pseudospin
orientation can be measured in photonic systems with radiative modes. We
consider the specific example: a 2D planar cavity with two polarization
eigenmodes, where the pseudospin measurement can be performed via
polarization-resolved photoluminescence. We also consider the s-band of a
staggered honeycomb lattice for polarization-degenerate modes (scalar photons).
The sublattice pseudospin can be measured by performing spatially resolved
interferometric measurements. In the second part, we consider a more
complicated four-band model, which can be mapped to two entangled pseudospins.
We show how the QGT components can be obtained by measuring six angles. The
specific four-band system we considered is the s-band of a honeycomb lattice
for polarized (spinor) photons. We show that all six angles can indeed be
measured in this system. We simulate realistic experimental situations in all
cases. We find the photon eigenstates by solving Schrodinger equation including
pumping and finite lifetime, and then simulate the measurement of the relevant
angles to finally extract realistic mappings of the k-dependent QGT components.

typically used as a substitute. It is possible that for every individual,
treatment has a positive effect on surrogate, and surrogate has a positive
effect on primary outcome, but for some individuals, treatment has a negative
effect on primary outcome. For example, a treatment may be substantially
effective in preventing the stroke for everyone, and lowering the risk of
stroke is universally beneficial for a longer survival time, however, the
treatment may still cause death for some individuals. We define such
paradoxical phenomenon as individual surrogate paradox. The individual
surrogate paradox is preposed to capture the treatment effect heterogeneity,
which is unable to be described by either the surrogate paradox based on
average causal effect (ACE) (Chen et al., 2007) or that based on distributional
causal effect (DCE) (Ju and Geng, 2010). We investigate existing surrogate
criteria in terms of whether the individual surrogate paradox could manifest.
We find that only the strong binary surrogate can avoid such paradox without
additional assumptions. Utilizing the sharp bounds, we propose novel criteria
to exclude the individual surrogate paradox. Our methods are illustrated in an
application to determine the effect of the intensive glycemia on the risk of
development or progression of diabetic retinopathy.

operator directly. Hence, iterative algorithms should be implemented. Secondly,
the Helmholtz operator is non-unitary and non-diagonalizable which in turn
deteriorates the performances of the iterative algorithms (especially for high

to solve the problem iteratively. The numerical results show the performance of
the preconditioning operator in improving the convergence rate of the GMRES
algorithm for data modelling case. In the companion paper we discussed the
application of preconditioned data modelling algorithm in the context of

efficient forward-modelling engine along with local differential algorithm, to

pros and cons. Here, we only discuss frequency domain method with Krylov

requires good initial macro model of the physical properties and low frequency

to solve especially for high wavenumbers (high frequencies). Without
incorporation of high frequencies in the FWI algorithm we are not going to be

we introduce parameterized typestates (p-typestates). p-typestates associate a

the involvement of a new parameter $\tilde{\xi}$ in this solution makes it
different from Schwarzschild black hole. The Killing horizon, event horizon and

admittance matrix) and hybrid parameters is common. Moreover, network reduction
techniques (e.g., Kron reduction) are often applied to decrease the size of
large grid models (i.e., with hundreds or thousands of state variables),
thereby alleviating the computational burden. However, researchers normally
disregard the fact that the applicability of these methods is not generally

order for hybrid parameters to exist and Kron reduction to be feasible.
Recently, this problem was solved for the particular cases of monophase and
balanced triphase grids. This paper investigates the general case of unbalanced
polyphase grids. Firstly, conditions determining the rank of the so-called
compound nodal admittance matrix and its diagonal subblocks are deduced from
the characteristics of the electrical components and the network graph.
Secondly, the implications of these findings concerning the feasibility of Kron

A ""hotbooting"" Q-learning based computation offloading scheme is proposed for
an IoT device to achieve the optimal offloading performance without being aware

propose a fast deep Q-network (DQN) based offloading scheme, which combines the

random access memories. Successful implementation depends on a simultaneous
achievement of low switching current for the magnetization switching by
spin-transfer torque and high thermal stability, along with a continuous
reduction of junction size. Perpendicular-easy-axis CoFeB/MgO stacks possessing
interfacial anisotropy have paved the way down to 20-nm scale, below which a
new approach needs to be explored. Here we show magnetic tunnel junctions that
satisfy the requirements at ultrafine scale by revisiting shape anisotropy,
which is a classical part of magnetic anisotropy but has not been fully
utilized in the current perpendicular systems. Magnetization switching solely
driven by current is achieved for junctions smaller than 10 nm where sufficient
thermal stability is provided by shape anisotropy without adopting new material
systems. This work is expected to push forward the development of magnetic
tunnel junctions towards single-digit-nm-scale nano-magnetics/spintronics.

examine a dynamical probe scalar operator where its dynamics is due to a
time-dependent source, quantum quench, or out-of-equilibrium initial condition
in field theory with fixed or varying temperature and chemical potential. We
observe that the behavior of the scalar operator equilibration time with
respect to temperature or chemical potential can not be predicted merely by
field theory parameters and depends on how fast the energy is injected into the

equilibration time is shorter for thermodynamically stable systems. We also
observe that the rescaled equilibration time as one approaches the critical
point enhances and acquires an infinite slope though its value remains finite.
We show that for fast quenches, even though the system is far from equilibrium,
the dynamical critical exponent is the same as the one reported for
quasi-normal modes in the same background. However for slow quenches the

Closed-access receivers are distributed around the cluster centers of the
transmitters according to a symmetric normal distribution and can be served
only by the transmitters of their corresponding clusters. Open-access
receivers, on the other hand, are placed independently of the transmitters and
can be served by all transmitters. In all cases, the link distance distribution

Consequently, efforts have been devoted during recent years to develop
computational approaches to predict the interactions utilizing various sources

devised which is based on the protein sequence information. However, finding an
appropriate feature encoding to characterize the sequence of proteins is a
major challenge in such methods. In presented work, a sequence based method is
proposed to predict protein-protein interactions using N-Gram encoding

rotate in 3D-space, amino acid compositions have been considered with

cosmology for almost a century. However, its modern values derived by various
methods still disagree from each other by almost 10%; the greater values being
obtained by measurements at the relatively small distances (e.g., by Cepheid
stars as the standard candles), while the smaller values being characteristic
of the methods associated with huge spatial scales (e.g., the analysis of the
cosmic microwave background fluctuations). A reasonable way to resolve this
puzzle is to assume that the Hubble constant is inherently scale-dependent.
This idea seems to be particularly attractive in light of the latest
observational results on the early-type galaxies, where the dark-matter haloes
are almost absent. Therefore, an average contribution of the
irregularly-distributed dark matter to the rate of the cosmological expansion
should be substantially different at various spatial scales. As follows from
the rough estimates, the corresponding variation of the Hubble constant can be
10% and even more, which well explains the spread in its values obtained by the

the uncertain variables in a model are statistically independent, the Sobol'
indices may be easily interpreted and utilized. However, their interpretation
and utility is more challenging with statistically dependent variables. This
article develops an approximation theoretic perspective to interpret Sobol'
indices in the presence of variable dependencies. The value of this perspective
is demonstrated in the context of dimension reduction, a common application of
the Sobol' indices. Theoretical analysis and illustrative examples are
provided.

Portland cements developed over the last century. It is only within recent
decades, however, that calcium-aluminate melts and glasses have begun to
attract attention, bringing new functionalities in photonic and electronic
applications. These studies, though, have been limited to compositions close to
a deep eutectic from where glasses easily form. With the development of
contactless levitation furnaces the glass forming region can now be hugely
extended. We have taken advantage of these developments to rationalise, for the
first time, melt rheology with structural properties across this expanded
compositional range, substantiating this with atomistic simulation. In the
process, we have discovered that supercooled calcium-aluminates comprise a new
system where fragile-to-strong phase transitions are ubiquitous. Taking this
holistic approach, we have quantified the common basis of thermo-physical and
structural diversity in this novel glass-forming system, together with its
inherent polyamorphism.

  Electrolyte Solutions at Variable Temperature","21 pages, 7 figures",,"10.1063/1.5021508",,"cond-mat.soft physics.chem-ph physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The combinatorial explosion of empirical parameters in tens of thousands
presents a tremendous challenge for extended Debye-H\""uckel models to calculate
activity coefficients of aqueous mixtures of most important salts in chemistry.
The explosion of parameters originates from the phenomenological extension of
the Debye-H\""uckel theory that does not take steric and correlation effects of
ions and water into account. In contrast, the Poisson-Fermi theory developed in
recent years treats ions and water molecules as nonuniform hard spheres of any
size with interstitial voids and includes ion-water and ion-ion correlations.
We present a Poisson-Fermi model and numerical methods for calculating the
individual or mean activity coefficient of electrolyte solutions with any
arbitrary number of ionic species in a large range of salt concentrations and
temperatures. For each activity-concentration curve, we show that the
Poisson-Fermi model requires only three unchanging parameters at most to well
fit the corresponding experimental data. The three parameters are associated
with the Born radius of the solvation energy of an ion in electrolyte solution
that changes with salt concentrations in a highly nonlinear manner.

among communicating discrete systems to guide the discourse on
interoperability.
  The necessary set of unifying concepts is small and comprises essentially the
notion of discrete systems interacting by exchanging information. It is based
on a simple, but nevertheless complete classification of system interactions
with respect to information transport and processing. Information transport can
only be uni- or bidirectional and information processing is subclassified along
the binary dimensions of state, determinism and synchronicity.
  For interactions with bidirectional information flow we are able to define a
criterion for a layered structure of systems: we name a bidirectional
interaction ""horizontal"" if all interacting systems behave the same with
respect to state, determinism and synchronicity and we name it ""vertical"" ---
providing a semantic direction --- if there is a behavioral asymmetry between
the interacting systems with respect to these properties.
  It is shown that horizontal interactions are essentially stateful,
asynchronous and nondeterministic and are described by protocols. Vertical
interactions are essentially top-down-usage, described by object models or
operations, and bottom-up-observation, described by anonymous events.
  The reference model thereby helps us to understand the significant
relationships that are created between interacting discrete systems by their
interactions and guides us on how to talk about discrete system
interoperability.
  To show its conceptual power, we apply the reference model to assess several
other architectural models, communication technologies and so called software
design or architectural styles like SOA and REST.

on the two concepts of information and computable functionality. In short, data
is viewed as typed information. A data type is defined as a pair of a set of
distinguishable characters (an alphabet) and a set of operations (computable
functions) that operate on this alphabet as domain. Two different ways of
subtyping in the sense of Liskov and Wing are described, one for restriction
and one for extension of existing types. They lead to two different partial
orders on types. It is argued that the proposed data concept matches the
concept of characteristics (Merkmale) of the automation industry.

  nucleic acid detection, submitted to Chemistry Letters",,,,"physics.ins-det physics.app-ph physics.bio-ph physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Here, we report a facile method for electro-addressable functionalization of
a probe comprising of closely spaced three individually addressable carbon
fiber electrodes for detection of nucleic acids. First, a multi electrode array
probe comprising three adjacent carbon fiber electrodes was fabricated through
pulling a three-barrel glass capillary with a single carbon fiber in each
barrel using a micropuller. Second, electropolymerization based doping was used
for electro-addressable functionalization of the multi-electrode array probe.
To demonstrate that the current strategy works, anti-miR-34a was electrografted
on only one of three electrodes by electropolymerization of pyrrole on the
specific electrode. A second electrode was coated only with polypyrrole (PPy)
and the third was left unmodified. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
was used for analysis and the results clearly showed charge transfer resistance
of the PPy + anti-miR-34a modified electrode increased significantly after
hybridization, while charge transfer resistance of the other two electrodes
remained almost constant. The results demonstrate that the present strategy has
great potential for constructing multiplex nucleic acid micro/nano biosensors
for local and in situ detection of multiple nucleic acid molecules such as
miRNAs at a time.
