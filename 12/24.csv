to real-time data aggregation due to their incapability of maintaining PUs'

participation, it is of significant importance to protect their privacy as well
as to provide them a desirable cumulative compensation. Thus motivated, in this
paper, we propose LEPA, an efficient incentive mechanism to stimulate long-term
participation in real-time data aggregation. Specifically, we allow PUs to
preserve their privacy by reporting noisy data, the impact of which on the
aggregation accuracy is quantified with proper privacy and accuracy measures.
Then, we provide a framework that jointly optimizes the incentive schemes in
different time slots to ensure desirable cumulative compensation for PUs and
thereby prevent PUs from leaving the system halfway. Considering PUs' strategic
behaviors and combinatorial nature of the sensing tasks, we propose a
computationally efficient on-line auction with close-to-optimal performance in
presence of NP-hardness of winner user selection. We further show that the
proposed on-line auction satisfies desirable properties of truthfulness and
individual rationality. The performance of LEPA is validated by both
theoretical analysis and extensive simulations.

thermalization. Thus, while scrambling is obviously necessary for

regimes where tidal amplitudes and dissipation are small. With this model, we
prove that tidal flows are able to drive parametric subharmonic resonances of
internal waves, in a way reminiscent of the elliptical instability in rotating
fluids. The growth rates computed via Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) are in
very good agreement with WKB analysis and Floquet theory. We also investigate
the turbulence driven by this instability mechanism. With spatio-temporal
analysis, we show that it is a weak internal wave turbulence occurring at small
Froude and buoyancy Reynolds numbers. When the gap between the excitation and
the Brunt-V\""ais\""al\""a frequencies is increased, the frequency spectrum of
this wave turbulence displays a -2 power law reminiscent of the high-frequency

representative dynamical network model, characterizing the dynamics of random
threshold networks with both excitatory and inhibitory links. Varying the
fraction of excitatory links has a strong effect on the network's population
activity and its sensitivity to perturbation. The average degree $K$, known to
have a strong effect on the dynamics when small, loses its influence on the
dynamics as its value increases. Instead, the strength of inhibition is a
determinant of dynamics and sensitivity here, allowing for criticality only in
a specific corridor of inhibition. This criticality corridor requires that
excitation dominates, while the balance region corresponds to maximum
sensitivity to perturbation. We develop mean-field approximations of the
population activity and sensitivity and find that the network dynamics is
independent of degree distribution for high $K$. In a minimal model of an
adaptive threshold network we demonstrate how the dynamics remains robust
against changes in the topology. This adaptive model can be extended in order

subject to resource and user distribution constraints. In this paper, a novel
D2D network analysis framework is proposed to study the impacts of frequently
occurring subgraphs, known as motifs, on D2D network performance and to
determine an effective content dissemination strategy. In the proposed
framework, the distribution of devices in the D2D network is modeled as a
Thomas cluster process (TCP), and two graph structures, the star and chain
motifs, are studied in the communication graph. Based on the properties of the
TCP, closed-form analytical expressions for the statistical significance, the
outage probability, as well as the average throughput per device, are derived.
Simulation results corroborate the analytical derivations and show the
influence of different system topologies on the occurrence of motifs and the
D2D system throughput. More importantly, the results highlight that, as the
statistical significance of motifs increases, the system throughput will
initially increase, and, then, decrease. Hence, network operators can obtain
statistical significance regions for chain and star motifs that map to the
optimal content dissemination performance. Furthermore, using the obtained
regions and the analytical expressions for statistical significance, network
operators can effectively identify which clusters of devices can be leveraged

  Engineering, 2018",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present an approach to combining distributional semantic representations
induced from text corpora with manually constructed lexical-semantic networks.
While both kinds of semantic resources are available with high lexical
coverage, our aligned resource combines the domain specificity and availability
of contextual information from distributional models with the conciseness and
high quality of manually crafted lexical networks. We start with a
distributional representation of induced senses of vocabulary terms, which are
accompanied with rich context information given by related lexical items. We
then automatically disambiguate such representations to obtain a full-fledged
proto-conceptualization, i.e. a typed graph of induced word senses. In a final
step, this proto-conceptualization is aligned to a lexical ontology, resulting
in a hybrid aligned resource. Moreover, unmapped induced senses are associated
with a semantic type in order to connect them to the core resource. Manual
evaluations against ground-truth judgments for different stages of our method
as well as an extrinsic evaluation on a knowledge-based Word Sense
Disambiguation benchmark all indicate the high quality of the new hybrid
resource. Additionally, we show the benefits of enriching top-down lexical
knowledge resources with bottom-up distributional information from text for
addressing high-end knowledge acquisition tasks such as cleaning hypernym
graphs and learning taxonomies from scratch.

localized depletion of electrolyte concentration. This depletion can
significantly impact the system's time dependent resistance. For systems with
porous electrodes, electrolyte depletion can limit the rate of charging and
increase energy dissipation. Here we propose a theory to control and avoid
electrolyte depletion by tailoring the value and spatial distribution of
resistance in a porous electrode. We explore the somewhat counterintuitive idea
that increasing local spatial resistances of the solid electrode itself leads
to improved charging rate and minimal change in energy loss. We analytically
derive a simple expression for an electrode resistance profile that leads to
highly uniform electrolyte depletion. We use numerical simulations to explore
this theory and simulate spatiotemporal dynamics of electrolyte concentration
in the case of a supercapacitor with various tailored electrode resistance
profiles which avoid localized depletion. This increases charging rate up to
around 2-fold with minimal effect on overall dissipated energy in the system.

our Galaxy. We have observed 23 planetary nebulae at Galactocentric distances
of 8-21 kpc with Spitzer IRS. The abundances were calculated from infrared
emission lines, for which we observed the main ionisation states of neon,
sulphur, and argon, which are little affected by extinction and uncertainties
in temperature measurements or fluctuations within the planetary nebula. We
have complemented these observations with others from optical studies in the
literature, in order to reduce or avoid the need for ionisation correction
factors in abundance calculations. The overall abundances of our sample of
planetary nebulae in the Galactic anti-centre are lower than those in the solar
neighbourhood. The abundances of neon, sulphur, and argon from these stars are
consistent with a metallicity gradient from the solar neighbourhood up to

Natural Language Processing (NLP). But many non-latin languages have
hieroglyphic writing systems, involving a big alphabet with thousands or

are often ignored by the previous work. In this paper, we propose a novel
architecture employing two stacked Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) to
learn sub-character level representation and capture deeper level of semantic

neural architecture, we take Chinese Word Segmentation as a research case
example. Among those languages, Chinese is a typical case, for which every
character contains several components called radicals. Our networks employ a
shared radical level embedding to solve both Simplified and Traditional Chinese
Word Segmentation, without extra Traditional to Simplified Chinese conversion,
in such a highly end-to-end way the word segmentation can be significantly
simplified compared to the previous work. Radical level embeddings can also
capture deeper semantic meaning below character level and improve the system
performance of learning. By tying radical and character embeddings together,
the parameter count is reduced whereas semantic knowledge is shared and
transferred between two levels, boosting the performance largely. On 3 out of 4

properly designing RF combiners and performing multiple trainings, the proposed
channel estimation can approach the performance of fully-digital estimations
depending on the degree of channel spatial correlation and the number of RF

theoretically derived by relaxing the constant-magnitude constraint in a
specific single-training scenario, which is then extended to the design of
combiners for multiple trainings by Sequential and Alternating methods.
Further, we develop a technique to generate the phase-only RF combiners based
on the corresponding unconstrained ones to satisfy the constant-magnitude
constraints. The performance of the proposed hybrid channel estimation scheme
is examined by simulations under both nonparametric and spatial channel models.
The simulation results demonstrate that the estimated CSI can approach the

HI Ly alpha, in the rest frame of PG1211+143 (z=0.0809), this corresponds to an
outflow velocity of -16,980 km/s (outflow redshift z_out ~ -0.0551), matching
the moderate ionization X-ray absorption system detected in our Chandra

hadronic scattering and electromagnetic scattering amplitudes at high momentum
transfer in terms of the total number of fundamental constituents in the
initial and final states participating in the hard subprocess. The scaling laws
reflect the twist of the leading Fock state for each hadron and hence the
leading operator that creates the composite state from the vacuum. Thus, the
constituent counting scaling laws can be used to identify the twist of exotic
hadronic candidates such as tetraquarks and pentaquarks. Effective field
theories must consistently implement the scaling rules in order to be
consistent with the fundamental theory. Here we examine how one can apply
constituent counting rules for the exclusive production of one or two neutral
vector mesons $V^0$ in $e^+ e^-$ annihilation, processes in which the $V^0$ can
couple via intermediate photons. In case of a (narrow) real $V^0$, the photon
virtuality is fixed to a precise value $s_1 = m_{V^0}^2$, in effect treating
the $V^0$ as a single fundamental particle. Each real $V^0$ thus contributes to
the constituent counting rules with $N_{V_0} = 1$. In effect, the leading
operator underlying the $V^0$ has twist 1. Thus, in the specific physical case
of single or double on-shell $V^0$ production via intermediate photons, the
predicted scaling from counting rules coincides with Vector Meson Dominance
(VMD), an effective theory that treats $V^0$ as an elementary field. However,
the VMD prediction fails in the general case where the $V^0$ is not coupled
through an elementary photon field, and then the leading-twist interpolating
operator has twist $N_{V_0} = 2$. Analogous effects appear in $pp$ scattering
processes.

temperature control. Through this control mechanism, nanoscale cross-relaxation
spectroscopy of both electron and nuclear spins in the vicinity of the NV
centre are performed. We then show that through maintaining the magnet at a
constant temperature an order of magnitude improvement in the stability of the
NV qubit frequency can be achieved. This improved stability is tested in the
polarisation of a small ensemble of nearby $^{13}$C spins via resonant
cross-relaxation and the lifetime of this polarisation explored. The
effectiveness and relative simplicity of this technique may find use in the
realisation of portable spectroscopy and/or hyperpolarisation systems.

numerical optimization because of their cheap iteration costs, low memory
requirements, amenability to parallelization, and ability to exploit problem
structure. Three main algorithmic choices influence the performance of BCD
methods: the block partitioning strategy, the block selection rule, and the
block update rule. In this paper we explore all three of these building blocks
and propose variations for each that can significantly improve the progress
made by each BCD iteration. We (i) propose new greedy block-selection
strategies that guarantee more progress per iteration than the Gauss-Southwell
rule; (ii) explore practical issues like how to implement the new rules when
using ""variable"" blocks; (iii) explore the use of message-passing to compute
matrix or Newton updates efficiently on huge blocks for problems with sparse

control in the modern control theory. The solvability conditions of optimal

Riccati equation. However, these results highly depends on a strictly
assumption that the Riccati equation is regular. If the Riccati equation is
irregular, the controller could not be derived from the equilibrium condition.
This paper is concerned with the general stochastic linear quadratic (LQ) with
irregular Riccati equation. Different from the classical control theory for
regular LQ problems, a new approach of `multi-layer optimization' is proposed.
With the approach, we show that different controller entries of irregular-LQ

specified terminal constraint condition in different layers, which is much
different from the classical regular LQ control where all the controller
entries can be obtained from equilibrium condition in one layer based on
regular Riccati equation. The presented results clarify the differences of
open-loop control from closed-loop control in the aspects of solvability and
controller design and also explores in essentially the differences of regular
control from irregular control. Several examples are presented to show the

novel perspective of image-to-image translation. In general, change detection
aims to identify interesting changes between a given query image and a
reference image of the same scene taken at a different time. This problem
becomes a challenging one when query and reference images involve different
domains (e.g., time of the day, weather, and season) due to variations in
object appearance and a limited amount of training examples. In this study, we
address the above issue by leveraging a generative adversarial network (GAN).
Our key concept is to use a limited amount of training data to train a
GAN-based image translator that maps a reference image to a virtual image that
cannot be discriminated from query domain images. This enables us to treat the
cross-domain change detection task as an in-domain image comparison. This
allows us to leverage the large body of literature on in-domain generic change
detectors. In addition, we also consider the use of visual place recognition as
a method for mining more appropriate reference images over the space of virtual
images. Experiments validate efficacy of the proposed approach.

kernel, is a highly ill-posed problem. The problem can be solved in two parts:
i) estimate a blur kernel from the blurry image, and ii) given estimated blur
kernel, de-convolve blurry input to restore the target image. In this paper, by
interpreting an image patch as a signal on a weighted graph, we first argue
that a skeleton image---a proxy that retains the strong gradients of the target
but smooths out the details---can be used to accurately estimate the blur
kernel and has a unique bi-modal edge weight distribution. We then design a
reweighted graph total variation (RGTV) prior that can efficiently promote
bi-modal edge weight distribution given a blurry patch. However, minimizing a
blind image deblurring objective with RGTV results in a non-convex
non-differentiable optimization problem. We propose a fast algorithm that
solves for the skeleton image and the blur kernel alternately. Finally with the
computed blur kernel, recent non-blind image deblurring algorithms can be
applied to restore the target image. Experimental results show that our

robots A and B compared with animals (or plants) X and Y? These are both
interesting and deeply challenging questions. In this paper we address the
question ""how intelligent is your intelligent robot?"" by proposing that
embodied intelligence emerges from the interaction and integration of four
different and distinct kinds of intelligence. We then suggest a simple
diagrammatic representation on which these kinds of intelligence are shown as
four axes in a star diagram. A crude qualitative comparison of the intelligence
graphs of animals and robots both exposes and helps to explain the chronic
intelligence deficit of intelligent robots. Finally we examine the options for
determining numerical values for the four kinds of intelligence in an effort to
move toward a quantifiable intelligence vector.

dynamics of open quantum systems (OQSs). Although it is usually claimed to be a
concept inspired by classical Markovianity, the term quantum Markovianity is
used inconsistently and often unrigorously in the literature. In this report we
compare the descriptions of classical stochastic processes and quantum
stochastic processes (as arising in OQSs), and show that there are inherent
differences that lead to the non-trivial problem of characterizing quantum
non-Markovianity. Rather than proposing a single definition of quantum
Markovianity, we study a host of Markov-related concepts in the quantum regime.
Some of these concepts have long been used in quantum theory, such as quantum
white noise, factorization approximation, divisibility, Lindblad master
equation, etc.. Others are first proposed in this report, including those we
call past-future independence, no (quantum) information backflow, and
composability. All of these concepts are defined under a unified framework,
which allows us to rigorously build hierarchy relations among them. With
various examples, we argue that the current most often used definitions of
quantum Markovianity in the literature do not fully capture the memoryless
property of OQSs. In fact, quantum non-Markovianity is highly
context-dependent. The results in this report, summarized as a hierarchy
figure, bring clarity to the nature of quantum non-Markovianity.

discontinuities occurring when the interface-capturing schemes inconsistently
simulate compressible multi-material flows(when the specific heats ratio is
variable),various non-conservative or quasi-conservative numerical models have
been proposed. However, designing a consistent numerical algorithm, especially
using the high-order characteristic flux-split based finite-difference method
(CFS-FDM) is still an open question. In this study, a systematical analysis of
previous algorithms of the consistent implementing the high-order CFS-FDM for
such flows is performed, and the reasons of special treatments in these
algorithms are revealed. Based on this analysis, a new general numerical
methodology that successfully avoids any special treatments as those required
in previously reported algorithms, is derived. In this new algorithm, we
rewrite the non-conservative term as a conservative term with a source term
containing velocity divergence. By consistently treating the advection velocity
in the conservative term and velocity divergence in the source term by imposing
a new additional criterion, specifically, that a multi-fluid algorithm should
have the ability of maintaining a pure single-fluid, we finally derive a new
general algorithm that does not need any special treatment, and is very
convenient to implement. The results of some benchmark tests show that the
final algorithm not only maintains the velocity, pressure, and temperature
equlibria, but is also suitable for problems regarding the interaction of

of the ratio of mass to radius of neutron stars. This could be measured
precisely from the redshift of a narrow line produced on the surface. X-rays
bursts have been intensively searched for such features, but so far without
detection. Here instead we search for redshifted lines in the persistent
emission, where the accretion flow dominates over the surface emission. We
discuss the requirements for narrow lines to be produced, and show that narrow
absorption lines from highly ionized iron can potentially be observable in
accreting low mass X-ray binaries (low B field) which have either low spin or
low inclination so that Doppler broadening is small. This selects Serpens X-1
as the only potential candidate persistent LMXB due to its low inclination.
Including surface models in the broad band accretion flow model predicts that
the absorption line from He-like iron at 6.7 keV should be redshifted to $\sim$
5.1 - 5.7 keV (10 - 15 km for $1.4\mathrm{M_\odot}$) and have an equivalent
width of 0.8 - 8.0 eV for surface temperatures of 7 - 10 $\times$ 10$^6$ K. We
use the high resolution Chandra grating data to give a firm upper limit of 2 -
3 eV for an absorption line at $\sim 5$ keV. We discuss possible reasons for
this lack of detection (the surface temperature and the geometry of the

concept of `bioindicators', borrowed from ecology, to the urban context. The
objective is to use an `indicator group' of people to assess the quality of a
complex environment and its changes over time. Specifically, we analyze 92
million geolocated Twitter records across five US cities, allowing us to derive
socio-economic user profiles based on individual movement patterns. As a
proof-of-concept, we define users with a `high-income-profile' as an indicator
group and show that their visitation patterns are a suitable indicator for
expected future rent increases in different neighborhoods. The concept of
indicator groups highlights the potential of closely monitoring only a specific
subset of the population, rather than the population as a whole. If the
indicator group is defined appropriately for the phenomenon of interest, this
approach can yield early predictions while simultaneously reducing the amount
of data that needs to be collected and analyzed.

dispatching in the future Energy Internet. With interconnections among multiple
LAPPNs, power dispatching can be further extended to intra- and inter-LAPPN
power interchanges. It becomes a significant issue to schedule the two kinds of
power interchanges as, from a system perspective high utilization of available
scheduling time slots and low overall transmission loss should be guaranteed,
and from a subscriber perspective a high scheduled ratio of transmission
requests with a fair transmission sequence in terms of transmission urgency are
expected. To this end, we propose a cooperative power dispatching framework for
connected LAPPNs, including subscriber matching and two-layer power
transmission scheduling. The former matches subscribers from different LAPPNs,
considering both subscriber preferences and power transmission loss. The latter
coordinates the intra- and inter-LAPPN power packet transmission to maximize
the amount of energy delivered with a guaranteed fairness on user urgency.
Simulation results of a two-LAPPN system are provided, which demonstrate that
the proposed framework can achieve effective and efficient power dispatching in

how to manipulate the proportions of the two kinds of transmissions according

approximate a posterior distribution, which can be costly when the likelihood
or prior is expensive to evaluate. The number of samples can be reduced if we
can avoid repeated samples and those that are close to each other. This is the
idea behind deterministic sampling methods such as Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC).
However, the existing QMC methods aim at sampling from a uniform hypercube,
which can miss the high probability regions of the posterior distribution and
thus the approximation can be poor. Minimum energy design (MED) is a recently
proposed deterministic sampling method, which makes use of the posterior
evaluations to obtain a weighted space-filling design in the region of
interest. However, the existing implementation of MED is inefficient because it
requires several global optimizations and thus numerous evaluations of the
posterior. In this article, we develop an efficient algorithm that can generate
MED with few posterior evaluations. We also make several improvements to the
MED criterion to make it perform better in high dimensions. The advantages of
MED over MCMC and QMC are illustrated using an example of calibrating a
friction drilling process.

calculations. We have systematically investigated the effect of inter-ribbon
distance and ribbon width on the work function, field enhancement factor, band
gap and edge magnetism of zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs). It is found that
the work function of ZGNRs increases rapidly as the inter-ribbon distance Dx
increases, which is caused by the positive dipole at the edge of the ribbon.
For a given Dx, the work function of ZGNRs decreases as the ribbon width W
increases. The wider the width of ribbon, the stronger the effect of
inter-ribbon distance on the work function. Using a simple linear interpolation
model, we can obtain the work function of ZGNR of any ribbon-width. For the
case of Dx < W, the field enhancement factor increases rapidly as the
inter-ribbon distance increases. As we further increase Dx, the enhancement
factor increases slowly and then tends toward saturation. The inter-ribbon
distance of ZGNRs can modulate the magnitude of the band gap and edge
magnetism. These observations above can all be explained by the screening
effect.

with a prebiotic potential and for which no gas-phase formation route was
previously known. In the proposed scheme, the ancestor is ethanol and the
glycolaldehyde sister species are acetic acid (another iCOM with unknown
gas-phase formation routes) and formic acid. For the reactions of the new
scheme with no available data, we have performed electronic structure and
kinetics calculations deriving rate coefficients and branching ratios.
Furthermore, after a careful review of the chemistry literature, we revised the
available chemical networks, adding and correcting several reactions related to
glycolaldehyde, acetic acid and formic acid. The new chemical network has been
used in an astrochemical model to predict the abundance of glycolaldehyde,
acetic acid and formic acid. The predicted abundance of glycolaldehyde depends
on the ethanol abundance in the gas phase and is in excellent agreement with
the measured one in hot corinos and shock sites. Our new model overpredicts the
abundance of acetic acid and formic acid by about a factor of ten, which might
imply a yet incomplete reaction network.

- the standard query language for RDF data - rather little is known about the
exact limits of tractability for this language. In particular, this is the case
for SPARQL queries that contain the OPTIONAL-operator, even though it is one of
the most intensively studied features of SPARQL. The aim of our work is to
provide a more thorough picture of tractable classes of SPARQL queries.
  In general, SPARQL query evaluation is PSPACE-complete in combined
complexity, and it remains PSPACE-hard already for queries containing only the
OPTIONAL-operator. To amend this situation, research has focused on
""well-designed SPARQL queries"" and their recent generalization ""weakly
well-designed SPARQL queries"". For these two fragments the evaluation problem
is coNP-complete in the absence of projection and SigmaP2-complete otherwise.
Moreover, they have been shown to contain most SPARQL queries asked in
practical settings.
  In this paper, we study tractable classes of weakly well-designed queries in
parameterized complexity considering the equivalent formulation as pattern
trees. We give a complete characterization of the tractable classes in the case
without projection. Moreover, we show a characterization of all tractable
classes of simple well-designed pattern trees in the presence of projection.

authentication method for virtually all online services. To remedy the
situation, end-users are very often referred to password managers as a solution
to the password reuse and password weakness problems. However, to date the
actual impact of password managers on password security and reuse has not been
studied systematically.
  In this paper, we provide the first large-scale study of the password
managers' influence on users' real-life passwords. From 476 participants of an
online survey on users' password creation and management strategies, we recruit
170 participants that allowed us to monitor their passwords in-situ through a
browser plugin. In contrast to prior work, we collect the passwords' entry
methods (e.g., human or password manager) in addition to the passwords and
their metrics. Based on our collected data and our survey, we gain a more
complete picture of the factors that influence our participants' passwords'
strength and reuse. We quantify for the first time that password managers
indeed benefit the password strength and uniqueness, however, also our results
also suggest that those benefits depend on the users' strategies and that
managers without password generators rather aggravate the existing problems.

interaction terms suggested by chiral perturbation theory. The relationship of
the two low-energy effective coupling parameters for the relevant three nucleon
contact interaction terms $c_D$ and $c_E$ that reproduce the binding energy of
$^3$H and $^3$He has been emphasized and the physically relevant parameter
region has been illustrated using the binding energy of $^4$He. Further
justification of A-body interaction terms is outlined based on the
Okubo-Lee-Suzuki effective interaction method used in solving the nuclear
many-body problem within a finite model space. The third example we use is an
exactly solvable A-body extended pairing interaction applied to heavy nuclei
with a long isotopic chains, in particular using $^{132}$Sn and $^{208}$Pb as
closed core system illustrates a remarkable relationship between the extended
pairing strength $G(A)$ and the size of the valence space $\dim(A)$ for the
members of these two isotope chain: $G(A)=\alpha\dim(A)^{-\beta}$ with
$\alpha=259.436$ for Sn and $\alpha=366.77$ for Pb while the parameter $\beta$

succeed in cross-issue solidarity, and when do they instead become fragmented?
To address this, the mechanisms of cross-issue interaction have to be
understood. Prior work on opinion dynamics and political disagreement has
focused on single-issue consensus and polarization. Inspired by practices of
cross-issue movement building, we have developed a general model of multi-issue
opinion dynamics where agreement on one issue can promote greater inclusivity
in discussing other issues, thereby avoiding the pitfalls of exclusivist
interaction, where individuals engage only if they agree sufficiently on every
issue considered. Our model shows that as more issues come into play, consensus
and solidarity can only be maintained if inclusivity towards differing
positions is increased. We further investigate whether greater inclusivity and
compromise across issues lead people towards or away from normative truth,
thereby addressing concerns about the non-ideal nature of political consensus.

with the Arecibo Observatory and/or the Green Bank Telescope at frequencies
ranging from 327 MHz to 2.3 GHz. Most pulsars were observed with approximately
monthly cadence, with six high--timing-precision pulsars observed weekly, and
all were observed at widely separated frequencies at each observing epoch in
order to fit for time-variable dispersion delays. We describe our methods for
data processing, time-of-arrival (TOA) calculation, and the implementation of a
new, automated method for removing outlier TOAs. We fit a timing model for each
pulsar that includes spin, astrometric, and, if necessary, binary parameters,
in addition to time-variable dispersion delays and parameters that quantify
pulse-profile evolution with frequency. The new timing solutions provide three
new parallax measurements, two new Shapiro delay measurements, and two new
measurements of large orbital-period variations. We fit models that
characterize sources of noise for each pulsar. We find that 11 pulsars show
significant red noise, with generally smaller spectral indices than typically
measured for non-recycled pulsars, possibly suggesting a different origin.

recently identified as the most efficient barrier to cellular reprogramming in

H3K9me3 heterochromatin in post-mitotic cells by generating local enzyme

protection of chromatin-bound SUV39H1/2 from the turnovers of soluble proteins,
which can explain the uncoupling between the cellular contents in SUV39H1 mRNA

statistical corrections and so as to comply with the detailed balance

Several critical concentrations are distinguished: the residual monomer
concentation in equilibrium (RMC) and the critical nucleation concentration
(CNC), that is the threshold concentration of total subunits necessary for
initiating aggregation. When increasing the concentration of total subunits,
the RMC converges more strongly to its asymptotic value, the equilibrium
constant of depolymerization, for 3D aggregates and in case of nucleation. The
CNC moderately depends on the number of subunits in the nucleus, but sharply
