analysis and computational linguistics to identify and extract subjective
information in textual material. Opinion mining, also known as sentiment
analysis, has received a lot of attention in recent times, as it provides a
number of tools to analyse the public opinion on a number of different topics.
Comparative opinion mining is a subfield of opinion mining that deals with
identifying and extracting information that is expressed in a comparative form
(e.g.~""paper X is better than the Y""). Comparative opinion mining plays a very
important role when ones tries to evaluate something, as it provides a
reference point for the comparison. This paper provides a review of the area of
comparative opinion mining. It is the first review that cover specifically this
topic as all previous reviews dealt mostly with general opinion mining. This
survey covers comparative opinion mining from two different angles. One from
perspective of techniques and the other from perspective of comparative opinion
elements. It also incorporates preprocessing tools as well as dataset that were
used by the past researchers that can be useful to the future researchers in
the field of comparative opinion mining.

we call multi-material transport problem. This is a transportation problem,
where distinct commodities are transported simultaneously along a network. The
cost of the transportation depends on the network used to move the masses, as
it is common in models studied in branched transportation. The main novelty is
that in our model the cost per unit length of the network does not depend only
on the total flow, but on the actual quantity of each commodity. This allows to
take into account different interactions between the transported goods. We
propose an Eulerian formulation of the discrete problem, describing the flow of
each commodity through every point of the network. We provide minimal
assumptions on the cost, under which existence of solutions can be proved.
Moreover, we prove that, under mild additional assumptions, the problem can be
rephrased as a mass minimization problem in a class of rectifiable currents
with coefficients in a group, allowing to introduce a notion of calibration.
The latter result is new even in the well studied framework of the
""single-material"" branched transportation.

doublet absorption line. By removing the Na D contribution from stellar
atmospheres, we isolate the line profile of the Na D excess, which represents
the neutral gas in the ISM. The kinematics traced by the Na D excess show high
velocity and velocity dispersion for a fraction of galaxies, indicating the
presence of neutral gas outflows. We find that the kinematics measured from the
Na D excess are similar between AGNs and star-forming galaxies. Moreover, by
comparing the kinematics traced by the Na D excess and those by the [O
III]$\lambda$5007 line taken from Woo et al. (2017), which traces ionized
outflows driven by AGNs, we find no correlation between them. These results
demonstrate that the neutral gas in the ISM traced by the Na D excess and the
ionized gas traced by [O III] are kinematically independent, and AGN has no
impact on the neutral gas outflows. In contrast to [O III], we find that the
measured line-of-sight velocity shift and velocity dispersion of the Na D
excess increase for more face-on galaxies due to the projection effect,
supporting that Na D outflows are radially driven (i.e., perpendicular to the
major axis of galaxies), presumably due to star formation.

convection rolls for energy-constrained transport. Optimal designs for
enstrophy-constrained transport are significantly more difficult to describe:
we introduce a ""branching"" flow design with an unbounded number of degrees of
freedom and prove it achieves nearly optimal transport. The main technical tool
behind these results is a variational principle for evaluating the transport of
candidate designs. The principle admits dual formulations for bounding
transport from above and below. While the upper bound is closely related to the

because it presents an alternative strategy for reducing irreplicable findings
by freeing the user from the task of making up unwarranted high-resolution
assumptions. However, model updating as a mathematical operation is inherently
exact, hence updating imprecise models requires the user's judgment in choosing
among competing updating rules. These rules often lead to incompatible
inferences, and can exhibit unsettling phenomena like dilation, contraction and
sure loss, which cannot occur with the Bayes rule and precise probabilities. We
revisit a number of famous ""paradoxes"", including the three prisoners/Monty
Hall problem, revealing that a logical fallacy arises from a set of marginally
plausible yet jointly incommensurable assumptions when updating the underlying
imprecise model. We establish an equivalence between Simpson's paradox and an
implicit adoption of a pair of aggregation rules that induce sure loss. We also
explore behavioral discrepancies between the generalized Bayes rule, Dempster's
rule and the Geometric rule as alternative posterior updating rules for Choquet
capacities of order 2. We show that both the generalized Bayes rule and
Geometric rule are incapable of updating without prior information regardless
of how strong the information in our data is, and that Dempster's rule and the
Geometric rule can mathematically contradict each other with respect to
dilation and contraction. Our findings show that unsettling updates reflect a
collision between the rules' assumptions and the inexactness allowed by the
model itself, highlighting the invaluable role of judicious judgment in
handling low-resolution information, and the care we must take when applying
learning rules to update imprecise probabilities.

scales, all of which can potentially affect processes that take place on the
network. However, most data-driven approaches used to model time-varying
networks attempt to capture only a single characteristic time scale in
isolation --- typically associated with the short-time memory of a Markov chain
or with long-time abrupt changes caused by external or systemic events. Here we
propose a unified approach to model both aspects simultaneously, detecting
short and long-time behaviors of temporal networks. We do so by developing an
arbitrary-order mixed Markov model with change points, and using a
nonparametric Bayesian formulation that allows the Markov order and the
position of change points to be determined from data without overfitting. In
addition, we evaluate the quality of the multiscale model in its capacity to
reproduce the spreading of epidemics on the temporal network, and we show that
describing multiple time scales simultaneously has a synergistic effect, where
statistically significant features are uncovered that otherwise would remain
hidden by treating each time scale independently.

methods to combat atmospheric turbulence require a threshold value determined

we pre-determine the optimal threshold value even before quantum transmission.
Therefore, the receiver can discard useless data immediately, thus greatly
reducing data storage requirement and computing resource. Furthermore, our
method can be applied to a variety of protocols, including, for example, not
only single-photon BB84, but also asymptotic and finite-size decoy-state BB84,
which can greatly increase its practicality.

Therefore, the extension of thermodynamic concepts, such as entropy, to small

include thermodynamic (hydrodynamic), Boltzmann, and Gibbs-Shannon entropies.
We shall argue that, despite its common use, the last is not an appropriate
physical entropy for such systems, either isolated or in contact with thermal
reservoirs: physical entropies should depend on the microstate of the system,
not on a subjective probability distribution. To square this point of view with
experimental results of Bechhoefer we shall argue that the Gibbs-Shannon
entropy of a nano particle in a thermal fluid should be interpreted as the
Boltzmann entropy of a dilute gas of Brownian particles in the fluid.

well as high-resolution optical spectroscopy with the Hamilton Echelle on the

optical spectroscopy data demonstrate that RZ Psc is a pre-main sequence star
with an effective temperature of 5600 $\pm$ 75 K and log g of 4.35 $\pm$ 0.10.
The ratio of X-ray to bolometric luminosity, log L$_{X}$/L$_{bol}$, lies in the
range -3.7 to -3.2, consistent with ratios typical of young, solar-mass stars,
thereby providing strong support for the young star status of RZ Psc. The Li
absorption line strength of RZ Psc suggests an age in the range 30-50 Myr,
which in turn implies that RZ Psc lies at a distance of $\sim$170 pc. Adopting
this estimated distance, we find the Galactic space velocity of RZ Psc to be
similar to the space velocities of stars in young moving groups near the Sun.
Optical spectral features indicative of activity and/or circumstellar material
are present in our spectra over multiple epochs, which provide evidence for the
presence of a significant mass of circumstellar gas associated with RZ Psc. We
suggest that the destruction of one or more massive orbiting bodies has
recently occurred within 1 au of the star, and we are viewing the aftermath of
such an event along the plane of the orbiting debris.

commission paid by the advertiser which is determined by the spread of its
product information. Meanwhile, to propagate influence, the activities
performed by users such as viewing video ads normally induce diffusion cost to
the OSN provider. In this paper, we aim to find a seed set to optimize a new
profit metric that combines the benefit of influence spread with the cost of
influence propagation for the OSN provider. Under many diffusion models, our
profit metric is the difference between two submodular functions which is
challenging to optimize as it is neither submodular nor monotone. We design a
general two-phase framework to select seeds for profit maximization and develop
several bounds to measure the quality of the seed set constructed. Experimental

the theory of difference equations. Classical feedforward neural networks, such
as those with tanh activations, exhibit exponential behavior on the average

dynamics causes rapid collapsing of the input space geometry, while the
exponential backward dynamics causes drastic vanishing or exploding gradients.
We show, in contrast, that by adding skip connections, the network will,
depending on the nonlinearity, adopt subexponential forward and backward
dynamics, and in many cases in fact polynomial. The exponents of these
polynomials are obtained through analytic methods and proved and verified
empirically to be correct. In terms of the ""edge of chaos"" hypothesis, these
subexponential and polynomial laws allow residual networks to ""hover over the
boundary between stability and chaos,"" thus preserving the geometry of the
input space and the gradient information flow. In our experiments, for each
activation function we study here, we initialize residual networks with
different hyperparameters and train them on MNIST. Remarkably, our
initialization time theory can accurately predict test time performance of
these networks, by tracking either the expected amount of gradient explosion or
the expected squared distance between the images of two input vectors.
Importantly, we show, theoretically as well as empirically, that common
initializations such as the Xavier or the He schemes are not optimal for
residual networks, because the optimal initialization variances depend on the
depth. Finally, we have made mathematical contributions by deriving several new
identities for the kernels of powers of ReLU functions by relating them to the

exact distributions of random errors and the parametric component are mostly
unknown and cannot safely assumed to be normal. An estimator of the functional
component that is adaptive in the mean squared sense over the wide range of
multivariate Besov classes and robust to a wide choice of distributions of the
linear component and random errors is constructed. It is also shown that the
same estimator is locally adaptive over the same range of Besov classes and
robust over large collections of distributions of the linear component and
random errors as well. At any fixed point, this estimator also attains a local
adaptive minimax rate. The procedure needed to obtain such an estimator turns
out to depend on the choice of the right shrinkage approach in the wavelet
domain. We show that one possible approach is to use the multivariate version

major challenges. As one example of such a challenge, the communications among
things will have to be flexible and adaptive to rapidly changing situations and
military missions. In this paper, we explore this and several other major
challenges of IoBT, and outline key research directions and approaches towards
solving these challenges.

In this paper, we take one step back and investigate the formulation of FBSDEs.
Motivated from several considerations, both in theory and in applications, we
propose to study FBSDEs in weak formulation, rather than the strong formulation
in the standard literature. That is, the backward SDE is driven by the forward
component, instead of by the Brownian motion noise. We establish the Feyman-Kac

polarization of light and thus increases the manipulation error for a spin-OAM

global phase to the OAM mode. In this work, we implemented a high-dimensional

It aims at
learning a function which estimates the targets for test inputs as precise as
possible. Generally, the function value for a test input is estimated by a
weighted average of the surrounding training examples. The weights are
typically computed by a distance-based kernel function and they strongly depend
on the distances between examples. In this paper, we first review the latest
developments of sparse metric learning and kernel regression. Then a novel
kernel regression method involving sparse metric learning, which is called
kernel regression with sparse metric learning (KR$\_$SML), is proposed. The
sparse kernel regression model is established by enforcing a mixed $(2,1)$-norm
regularization over the metric matrix. It learns a Mahalanobis distance metric
by a gradient descent procedure, which can simultaneously conduct
dimensionality reduction and lead to good prediction results. Our work is the
first to combine kernel regression with sparse metric learning. To verify the
effectiveness of the proposed method, it is evaluated on 19 data sets for
regression. Furthermore, the new method is also applied to solving practical
problems of forecasting short-term traffic flows. In the end, we compare the
proposed method with other three related kernel regression methods on all test
data sets under two criterions. Experimental results show that the proposed
method is much more competitive.

theoretical interests given its potential paradigm-shifting impacts in areas
like spin-thermoelectrics, spin-caloritronics and spintronics. Modelling
studies of the transport of magnons and phonons in magnetic crystals are very
rare. In this paper, we use spin-lattice dynamics (SLD) simulations to model
ferromagnetic crystalline iron, where the spin and lattice systems are coupled
through the atomic position-dependent exchange function, and thus the
interaction between magnon and phonon is naturally considered. We then present
a method combining SLD simulations with spectral energy analysis to calculate
the magnon and phonon harmonic (e.g., dispersion, specific heat, group
velocity) and anharmonic (e.g., scattering rate) properties, based on which
their thermal conductivity values are calculated. This work represents an
example of using SLD simulations to understand the transport properties
involving coupled magnon and phonon dynamics.

under microwave pulse irradiation. We consider the effect of paramagnetic
impurities on the THG intensity of dirty superconductors. The nonlinear
response function is calculated using the method of the quasiclassical Green
function. It is shown that the amplitude mode is included as the vertex
correction and makes a predominant contribution to the THG intensity. When the
effect of paramagnetic impurities is weak, the THG intensity shows a peak at
the temperature at which the superconducting gap is about the same as the
frequency of the incident pulse, similarly to in experiments. As the effect of
paramagnetic impurities is strengthened, the peak of the THG intensity
disappears. This indicates that time-reversal symmetry breaking due to
paramagnetic impurities eliminates the well-defined amplitude mode. The result
of our calculation shows that the existence of the amplitude mode can be
confirmed through the THG intensity. The result of a semiquantitative
calculation is in good agreement with the experimental result, and it also
shows that the diamagnetic term is negligible.

analysis has been applied to many areas, e.g., product recommendation,
clustering and Web search. Most of the existing metrics depend on the meta-path
or meta-structure specified by users in advance. These metrics are thus
sensitive to the pre-specified meta-path or meta-structure. In this paper, a
novel similarity measure in heterogeneous information networks, called
Recurrent Meta-Structure-based Similarity (RMSS), is proposed. The recurrent
meta-structure as a schematic structure in heterogeneous information networks
provides a unified framework to integrate all of the meta-paths and
meta-structures. Therefore, RMSS is robust to the meta-paths and
meta-structures. We devise an approach to automatically constructing the
recurrent meta-structure. In order to formalize the semantics, the recurrent
meta-structure is decomposed into several recurrent meta-paths and recurrent
meta-trees, and we then define the commuting matrices of the recurrent
meta-paths and meta-trees. All of the commuting matrices of the recurrent
meta-paths and meta-trees are combined according to different weights. Note
that the weights can be determined by two kinds of weighting strategies: local
weighting strategy and global weighting strategy. As a result, RMSS is defined
by virtue of the final commuting matrix. Experimental evaluations show that the
existing metrics are sensitive to different meta-paths or meta-structures and
that the proposed RMSS outperforms the existing metrics in terms of ranking and
clustering tasks.

inversion symmetry and plays the same role as Rashba spin-orbit coupling. In
the inverted bands, this model can open a proper parameter regime for

can realize topological phase with much weaker attractive interaction, as

syntactical symbols in a program can lead to systems which experience semantics
and qualia. We address this question in three stages. First, we introduce a new
class of human semantic symbols which appears when unexpected and drastic
environmental change causes humans to become surprised, confused, uncertain,
and in extreme cases, unresponsive, passive and dysfunctional. For this class
of symbols, pre-learned programs become inoperative so these syntactical
programs cannot be the source of experienced qualia. Second, we model the
dysfunctional human response to a radically changed environment as being the
natural response of any learning machine facing novel inputs from well outside
its previous training set. In this situation, learning machines are unable to
extract information from their input and will typically enter a dynamical state
characterized by null outputs and a lack of response. This state immediately
predicts and explains the characteristics of the semantic experiences of humans
in similar circumstances. In the third stage, we consider learning machines
trained to implement multiple functions in simple sequential programs using
environmental data to specify subroutine names, control flow instructions,
memory calls, and so on. Drastic change in any of these environmental inputs
can again lead to inoperative programs. By examining changes specific to people
or locations we can model human cognitive symbols featuring these dependencies,
such as attachment and grief. Our approach links known dynamical machines
states with human qualia and thus offers new insight into the hard problem of
artificial intelligence.

selection using global geochemical datasets containing data for volcanic rocks
generated in eight different tectonic settings. This study uses support vector
machine, random forest, and sparse multinomial regression (SMR) approaches. All
these ML methods with data for 20 elements and 5 isotopic ratios allowed the
successful geochemical discrimination between igneous rocks formed in eight
different tectonic settings with a discriminant ratio better than 83% for all
settings barring oceanic plateaus and back-arc basins. SMR is a particularly
powerful and interpretable ML method because it quantitatively identifies
geochemical signatures that characterize the tectonic settings of interest and
the characteristics of each sample as a probability of the membership of the
sample for each setting. We also present the most representative basalt
composition for each tectonic setting. The new data provide reference points
for future geochemical discussions. Our results indicate that at least 17
elements and isotopic ratios are required to characterize each tectonic
setting, suggesting that geochemical tectonic discrimination cannot be achieved
using only a small number of elemental compositions and/or isotopic ratios. The
results show that volcanic rocks formed in different tectonic settings have
unique geochemical signatures, indicating that both volcanic rock geochemistry

Spatially-extended enhancements in the 6.4 keV line and in soft X-rays are
found inside or on the radio shell. The soft X-ray enhancement would be the
hottest part of the shell-like X-ray emission along the radio shell. The 6.4
keV line enhancement is detected at a significance level of $4.1 \sigma$. The
lower limit of the equivalent width (EW) is 1.2 keV. The energy centroid of the
6.4 keV line is $6.40 \pm 0.04$ keV, indicating that the iron is less ionized
than the Ne-like state. If the 6.4 keV line originates from ionizing
non-equilibrium thermal plasma, presence of iron-rich ejecta in a
low-ionization state is required, which is disfavored by the relatively old age
of the SNR. The 6.4 keV line enhancement would be due to K-shell ionization of
iron atoms in a dense interstellar medium by high-energy particles. Since there
is no irradiating X-ray source, the origin of the 6.4 keV line enhancement is
not likely the photoionization. The large EW can only be explained by K-shell
ionization due to cosmic-ray protons with an energy of $\sim 10$ MeV, which
might be generated by the shock acceleration in G323.7$-$1.0.

  Transfer","22 pages, 7 figures, ACCV2018 submission",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many methods have been proposed to solve the domain adaptation problem
recently. However, the success of them implicitly funds on the assumption that
the information of domains are fully transferrable. If the assumption is not
satisfied, the effect of negative transfer may degrade domain adaptation. In
this paper, a better learning network has been proposed by considering three
tasks - domain adaptation, disentangled representation, and style transfer
simultaneously. Firstly, the learned features are disentangled into common
parts and specific parts. The common parts represent the transferrable
features, which are suitable for domain adaptation with less negative transfer.
Conversely, the specific parts characterize the unique style of each individual
domain. Based on this, the new concept of feature exchange across domains,
which can not only enhance the transferability of common features but also be
useful for image style transfer, is introduced. These designs allow us to
introduce five types of training objectives to realize the three challenging
tasks at the same time. The experimental results show that our architecture can
be adaptive well to full transfer learning and partial transfer learning upon a
well-learned disentangled representation. Besides, the trained network also
demonstrates high potential to generate style-transferred images.

physical properties and evolutionary states are investigated. The period
distribution of EAs suggests that the period limit of tidal locking for the
close binaries is about 6 days. It is found that the metallicity of EAs is
higher than that of EWs indicating that EAs are generally younger than EWs and
they are the progenitors of EWs. The metallicities of long-period EWs (0.4 < P
< 1 days) are the same as those of EAs with the same periods, while their
values of Log (g) are usually smaller than those of EAs. These support the
evolutionary process that EAs evolve into long-period EWs through the
combination of angular momentum loss (AML) via magnetic braking and case A mass
transfer. For short-period EWs, their metallicities are lower than those of
EAs, while their gravitational accelerations are higher. These reveal that they
may be formed from cool short-period EAs through AML via magnetic braking with
little mass transfer. For some EWs with high metallicities, they may be
contaminated by material from the evolution of unseen neutron stars and black
holes or they have third bodies that may help them to form rapidly through a
short timescale of pre-contact evolution. The present investigation suggests
that the modern EW populations may be formed through the combination of
aforementioned mechanisms.

guide a fresh laser pulse into a subsequent straight channel, while allowing
the electrons to propagate in a straight channel. This scheme benefits from a
shorter coupling distance and continuous guiding of the electrons in plasma,

\mathbb{C}$, is equivalent to a projective-invariant equation for an affine
connection on a one-dimensional complex manifold with projective structure. By
exploiting this geometric connection it is shown that the Chazy XII solution,
for certain values of $K$, can be expressed as $y=a_1w_1+a_2w_2+a_3w_3$ where
$w_i$ solve the generalized Darboux-Halphen system. This relationship holds
only for certain values of the coefficients $(a_1,a_2,a_3)$ and the
Darboux-Halphen parameters $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$, which are enumerated in
Table 2. Consequently, the Chazy XII solution $y(z)$ is parametrized by a
particular class of Schwarz triangle functions $S(\alpha, \beta, \gamma; z)$
which are used to represent the solutions $w_i$ of the Darboux-Halphen system.
The paper only considers the case where $\alpha+\beta+\gamma<1$. The associated
triangle functions are related among themselves via rational maps that are
derived from the classical algebraic transformations of hypergeometric
functions. The Chazy XII equation is also shown to be equivalent to a
Ramanujan-type differential system for a triple $(\hat{P}, \hat{Q},\hat{R})$.

set. A pair of ordered graphs is Ramsey finite if it has only finitely many

graph F is an ordered Ramsey graph of a pair (H,H') of ordered graphs if for
any coloring of the edges of F in colors red and blue there is either a copy of
H with all edges colored red or a copy of H' with all edges colored blue. Such
an ordered Ramsey graph is minimal if neither of its proper subgraphs is an
ordered Ramsey graph of (H,H'). If H=H' then H itself is called Ramsey finite.
  We show that a connected ordered graph is Ramsey finite if and only if it is
a star with center being the first or the last vertex in the linear order. In
general we prove that each Ramsey finite (not necessarily connected) ordered
graph H has a pseudoforest as a Ramsey graph and therefore is a star forest
with strong restrictions on the positions of the centers of the stars. In the
asymmetric case we show that (H,H') is Ramsey finite whenever H is a so-called
monotone matching. Among several further results we show that there are Ramsey
finite pairs of ordered stars and ordered caterpillars of arbitrary size and
diameter. This is in contrast to the unordered setting where for any Ramsey
finite pair (H,H') of forests either one of H or H' is a matching or both are
star forests (with additional constraints).
  Several of our results give a relation between Ramsey finiteness and the
existence of sparse ordered Ramsey graphs. Motivated by these relations we
characterize all pairs of ordered graphs that have a forest as an ordered

grating is essential for improving the manufacturing technique and for
assessing the grating's function in practical applications. The drawback of the
currently popular measurement technique is its slow speed due to the hundreds
of repetitions of two kinds of time-consuming mechanical movements during the
measuring process (i.e., the rotation of the mechanical arm to capture the
light beam, and the mechanical variation of the output wavelength of the
grating monochromator). This limitation greatly restricts the usage of this
technique in dynamic measurement. In this manuscript, we present a motionless
and fast measurement technique for obtaining the spectral diffraction
efficiencies of a plane grating, effectively eliminating the aforementioned two
kinds of mechanical movement. Herein, the proposed solution for removing the
first kind of mechanical movement is tested, and the experimental result shows
that the proposed method can be successfully used to measure the plane
transmission grating's spectral diffraction efficiencies in the wavelength
range of 550-750 nm. The method for eliminating the second kind of mechanical
movement is not verified in this manuscript; however, we think that it is very
straightforward and commercially available. We estimate that the spectral
measurement can be achieved on a millisecond timescale by combining the two

can be described as a helical Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid. They couple to nuclear
spins embedded in the host materials through the hyperfine interaction, and are
therefore subject to elastic spin-flip backscattering on the nuclear spins. We
investigate the nuclear-spin-induced edge resistance due to such backscattering
by performing a renormalization-group analysis. Remarkably, the effect of this
backscattering mechanism is stronger in a helical edge than in nonhelical
channels, which are believed to be present in the trivial regime of InAs/GaSb
quantum wells. In a system with sufficiently long edges, the disordered nuclear
spins lead to an edge resistance which grows exponentially upon lowering the
temperature. On the other hand, electrons from the edge states mediate an
anisotropic Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida nuclear spin-spin interaction, which
induces a spiral nuclear spin order below the transition temperature. We
discuss the features of the spiral order, as well as its experimental
signatures. In the ordered phase, we identify two backscattering mechanisms,
due to charge impurities and magnons. The backscattering on charge impurities
is allowed by the internally generated magnetic field, and leads to an
Anderson-type localization of the edge states. The magnon-mediated
backscattering results in a power-law resistance, which is suppressed at zero
temperature. Overall, we find that in a sufficiently long edge the nuclear
spins, whether ordered or not, suppress the edge conductance to zero as the
temperature approaches zero.

using cosmic-ray particle detectors due to the low elevation of the Galactic

will help in this case, and would allow for a 24/7 operation time. So far, only
air showers with energies well above 10 PeV have been detected with the radio
technique. Thus, the energy threshold has to be lowered for the detection of
gamma-ray showers of PeV energy. This can be achieved by optimizing the
frequency band in order to obtain a higher level of signal-to-noise ratio. With
such an approach, PeV gamma-ray showers with high inclination can be measured

a generic recommender framework called Neural Collaborative Autoencoder (NCAE)

QFP wave lasted during the entire flare lifetime rather than only the rising
phase of the accompanying flare as reported in previous studies. In addition,
the propagation of the different parts of the wave train showed different
kinematics and morphologies. For the southern (northern) part, the speed,
duration, intensity variation are about 875 +/- 29 (1485 +/- 233) km/s, 45 (60)

the northern part of the wave train showed obvious refraction effect when they
pass through a region of strong magnetic field. Periodicity analysis result
indicates that all the periods of the QFP wave can be found in the period

propose that the quasi-periodic nonlinear magnetohydrodynamics process in the

Image cropping, which refers to the removal of unwanted scene areas, is an

proposed CCR method improves the convergence speed of the cascaded method,

lacking labelled cropping data. Specifically, a deep convolutional neural
network (CNN) classifier is first trained on large-scale visual aesthetic
datasets. The deep CNN model is then designed to extract features from several
image cropping datasets, upon which the cropping bounding boxes are predicted
by the proposed CCR method. Experimental results on public image cropping

by using characteristic values of the magnetic induction radial component and

conclusion that the formed shock is a bow one relative to the CME body moving

steeping of the front edge of the coronal plasma disturbed region ahead of the

fundamental property of QDs for thees applications. From the symmetry point of
view, since the two bright exciton states belong to two different
representations for QDs with C2v symmetry, they should not only have different
energies, but also have different lifetimes, which is termed exciton lifetime
asymmetry. In contrast to extensively studied FSS, the investigation of the
exciton lifetime asymmetry is still missed in literature. In this work, we
carried out the first investigation of the exciton lifetime asymmetry in
self-assembled QDs and presented a theory to deduce lifetime asymmetry
indirectly from measurable qualities of QDs. We further revealed that intrinsic
lifetimes and their asymmetry are fundamental quantities of QDs, which
determine the bound of the extrinsic lifetime asymmetries, polarization angles,
FSSs, and their evolution under uniaxial external forces. Our findings provide
an important basis to deeply understanding properties of QDs.

Se atomic layer in $\mathrm{MoSe_2}$ by S atoms. In this work, Janus monolayer
ZrSSe is proposed by ab initio calculations. For the electron part, the
generalized gradient approximation (GGA) plus spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is used
as exchange-correlation potential, while GGA for lattice part. Calculated
results show that the ZrSSe monolayer is dynamically and mechanically stable,
which exhibits mechanical flexibility due to small Young's modulus. It is found
that ZrSSe monolayer is an indirect-gap semiconductors with band gap of 0.60
eV. The electronic and phonon transports of ZrSSe monolayer are investigated by
semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory. In n-type doping, the $ZT_e$ between
ZrSSe and $\mathrm{ZrS_2}$ monolayers is almost the same due to similar
outlines of conduction bands. The p-type $ZT_e$ of ZrSSe monolayer is lower
than that of $\mathrm{ZrS_2}$ monolayer, which is due to larger spin-orbit
splitting for ZrSSe than $\mathrm{ZrS_2}$ monolayer. The room-temperature sheet
thermal conductance is 33.6 $\mathrm{W K^{-1}}$ for ZrSSe monolayer, which is
lower than 47.8 $\mathrm{W K^{-1}}$ of $\mathrm{ZrS_2}$ monolayer. Compared to
$\mathrm{ZrS_2}$ monolayer, the low sheet thermal conductance of ZrSSe
monolayer is mainly due to small group velocities and short phonon lifetimes of
ZA mode. Considering their $ZT_e$ and lattice thermal conductivities, the ZrSSe
monolayer may have better n-type thermoelectric performance than

placing more points in the regions with high probability mass. However, noise

be relatively small and neglected. Here we demonstrate that the electric
quadrupolar contribution not only cannot be ignored, but also plays a key role

molecular orientations and is located at the hotspot of plasmonic
nanostructures, the plasmonic CD strength contributed by molecular electric
quadrupoles (EQ) can be two orders of magnitude higher than that contributed by
molecular electric/magnetic dipoles. Unlike the case of dipole approximation,
molecular EQ associated plasmonic CD activity appears mainly at the plasmonic
resonance absorptions that facilitate the optically enhanced near-field with
steep electric filed gradients, and is correlated with the boosted emission
rate of a molecular EQ. Based on such physical understandings, we can design
nanostructures to realize giant chiroptical effect using the EQ contribution

systems where a user draws a secret string of given length with i.i.d.
characters from a finite alphabet, and an adversary would like to identify the
secret string by querying, or guessing, the identity of the string. The concept
of a ""total entropy budget"" on the chosen word by the user is natural,
otherwise the chosen password would have arbitrary length and complexity. One
intuitively expects that a password chosen from the uniform distribution is
more secure. This is not the case, however, if we are considering only the
average guesswork of the adversary when the user is subject to a total entropy
budget. The optimality of the uniform distribution for the user's secret string
holds when we have also a budget on the guessing adversary. We suppose that the
user is subject to a ""total entropy budget"" for choosing the secret string,
whereas the computational capability of the adversary is determined by his
""total guesswork budget."" We study the regime where the adversary's chances are
exponentially small in guessing the secret string chosen subject to a total
entropy budget. We introduce a certain notion of uniformity and show that a
more uniform source will provide better protection against the adversary in
terms of his chances of success in guessing the secret string. In contrast, the
average number of queries that it takes the adversary to identify the secret
string is smaller for the more uniform secret string subject to the same total
entropy budget.

traffic times in wireless network, coded caching has been widely studied
recently. And several coded caching schemes are constructed focusing on the two
core problems in practice, i.e., the rate transmitted during the peak traffic
times and the packet number of each file divided during the off peak traffic
times. It is well known that there exits a tradeoff between the rate and the
packet number. In this paper, a novel recursive construction is proposed. As an
application, several new schemes are obtained. Comparing with previously known
schemes, new schemes could further reduce packet number by increasing little
rate. And for some parameters in coded caching systems, the packet number of
our new schemes are smaller than that of schemes generated by memory sharing

the study of strongly inhomogeneous Luttinger liquids (LL) where the properties
of free fermions plus the source of inhomogeneities are reproduced exactly. The
formalism of NCBT is introduced and limiting case checks, fermion commutation
rules, point splitting constraints, etc. are discussed. The Green functions
obtained from NCBT are expanded in powers of the fermion-fermion interaction
strength (forward scattering short-range only) and compared with the
corresponding terms obtained using standard fermionic perturbation theory.
Lastly, the Green functions obtained from NCBT are inserted into the
Schwinger-Dyson equation which is the equation of motion of the Green functions
and serves as a non-perturbative confirmation of the method. Some other
analytical approaches like functional bosonization and numerical techniques
like DMRG, which can be used to obtain the correlation functions in 1D, are
briefly discussed.

In particular, a denominator theorem has been proved, which enables us to
establish the linearly independence of denominator vectors of cluster variables

topic in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). This paper does a lot of
research on network-scale modeling and forecasting of short-term traffic flows.
Firstly, we propose the concepts of single-link and multi-link models of
traffic flow forecasting. Secondly, we construct four prediction models by
combining the two models with single-task learning and multi-task learning. The
combination of the multi-link model and multi-task learning not only improves
the experimental efficiency but also the prediction accuracy. Moreover, a new
multi-link single-task approach that combines graphical lasso (GL) with neural
network (NN) is proposed. GL provides a general methodology for solving
problems involving lots of variables. Using L1 regularization, GL builds a
sparse graphical model making use of the sparse inverse covariance matrix. In
addition, Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a classic regression algorithm
in Bayesian machine learning. Although there is wide research on GPR, there are
few applications of GPR in traffic flow forecasting. In this paper, we apply
GPR to traffic flow forecasting and show its potential. Through sufficient
experiments, we compare all of the proposed approaches and make an overall
assessment at last.

  version)",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In activity recognition, it is often expensive and time-consuming to acquire
sufficient activity labels. To solve this problem, transfer learning leverages
the labeled samples from the source domain to annotate the target domain which
has few or none labels. Existing approaches typically consider learning a
global domain shift while ignoring the intra-affinity between classes, which
will hinder the performance of the algorithms. In this paper, we propose a
novel and general cross-domain learning framework that can exploit the
intra-affinity of classes to perform intra-class knowledge transfer. The
proposed framework, referred to as Stratified Transfer Learning (STL), can
dramatically improve the classification accuracy for cross-domain activity
recognition. Specifically, STL first obtains pseudo labels for the target
domain via majority voting technique. Then, it performs intra-class knowledge
transfer iteratively to transform both domains into the same subspaces.
Finally, the labels of target domain are obtained via the second annotation. To
evaluate the performance of STL, we conduct comprehensive experiments on three
large public activity recognition datasets~(i.e. OPPORTUNITY, PAMAP2, and UCI
DSADS), which demonstrates that STL significantly outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods w.r.t. classification accuracy (improvement of 7.68%).
Furthermore, we extensively investigate the performance of STL across different
degrees of similarities and activity levels between domains. And we also
discuss the potential of STL in other pervasive computing applications to
provide empirical experience for future research.

standard model, and supergravity. In these theories, we used vector notation in
order to express a chiral or an anti-chiral matter superfield. We also
represented the NCG algebra and the Dirac operator by matrices which operated
on the space of matter field. In this paper, we represent the triple in the
superspace coordinate system $(x^\mu,\theta,\bar{\theta})$. We also introduce
""extracting operators"" and the new definition of the supertrace so that we can
also investigate the square of the Dirac operator on the Minkowskian manifold
in the superspace. We finally re-construct the super Yang--Mills theory on NCG

reducing carbon dioxide emissions from the plants. This is achieved by burning
the fossil fuel using oxygen as oxidizer with no nitrogen, thereby rendering
the exhaust gases very rich in carbon dioxide (after condensing water vapor by
cooling), which facilitates its capture for environmental or commercial
purposes. Despite the worldwide interest in oxy-fuel carbon capture, its
progress is at risk given the large energy needed to separate oxygen from air
in order to provide the oxidizer, thereby hindering further progress of this
concept toward large-scale applications. This paper focuses on alleviating this
drawback of oxy-fuel combustion by making it more attractive through combining
it with another concept, namely magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) power generators. The
end product is a power plant operating on a combined cycle composed of a
topping MHD ultra-high-temperature cycle with direct electricity extraction
from plasma, followed by a bottoming steam cycle with conventional
turbo-generators. Different design aspects and simplified technical analysis
for the MHD generator are presented.
