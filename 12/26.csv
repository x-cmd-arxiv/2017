fundamental information for object detection and instance segmentation to help
the artificial intelligence better understand real world. Since the proposal of
fully convolutional neural network (FCNN), it has been widely used in semantic
segmentation because of its high accuracy of pixel-wise classification as well
as high precision of localization. In this paper, we apply several famous FCNN
to brain tumor segmentation, making comparisons and adjusting network
architectures to achieve better performance measured by metrics such as
precision, recall, mean of intersection of union (mIoU) and dice score
coefficient (DSC). The adjustments to the classic FCNN include adding more
connections between convolutional layers, enlarging decoders after up sample
layers and changing the way shallower layers' information is reused. Besides
the structure modification, we also propose a new classifier with a
hierarchical dice loss. Inspired by the containing relationship between
classes, the loss function converts multiple classification to multiple binary
classification in order to counteract the negative effect caused by imbalance
data set. Massive experiments have been done on the training set and testing
set in order to assess our refined fully convolutional neural networks and new
types of loss function. Competitive figures prove they are more effective than
their predecessors.

accretion disks of T Tauri stars. The dynamical equations of our model take
into account the aerodynamic and turbulent drag forces, and the radiative heat
exchange between the MFT and ambient gas. The structure of the disk is
calculated with the help of our MHD model of the accretion disks. We consider
the MFTs formed at the distances $0.027-0.8$ au from the star with various
initial radii and plasma betas $\beta_0$. The simulations show that the MFT
with weak magnetic field ($\beta_0=10$) rise slowly with speeds less than the
sound speed. The MFTs with $\beta_0=1$ form outflowing magnetized corona of the
disk. Strongly magnetized MFTs ($\beta_0=0.1$) can cause the outflows with
velocities $20-50$ km s$^{-1}$. The tubes rise periodically over times from
several days to several months according to our simulations. We propose that
periodically rising MFTs can absorb stellar radiation and contribute to the
IR-variability of Young Stellar Objects.

Einstein equation with nonvanishing energy-momentum tensor for two scalar
fields. These scalar fields encode the information of the relevant deformation
of the ABJM theory. This confirms that the asymptotic limit of LLM geometry is
the emergent gravity of the quantum entanglement in the mass-deformed ABJM
theory with a small mass parameter. We also comment on the issue of the

simultaneously on the field of tuned-resonators buried in the soil, around

of above-surface resonators. In this perspective article, we quickly recall

distributed computing. For the last few years, substantial progress has been
made on the approximate single source shortest paths problem, culminating in an
algorithm of Becker et al. [DISC'17] which deterministically computes
$(1+o(1))$-approximate shortest paths in $\tilde O(D+\sqrt n)$ time, where $D$
is the hop-diameter of the graph. Up to logarithmic factors, this time
complexity is optimal, matching the lower bound of Elkin [STOC'04].
  The question of exact shortest paths however saw no algorithmic progress for
decades, until the recent breakthrough of Elkin [STOC'17], which established a
sublinear-time algorithm for exact single source shortest paths on undirected
graphs. Shortly after, Huang et al. [FOCS'17] provided improved algorithms for
exact all pairs shortest paths problem on directed graphs.
  In this paper, we present a new single-source shortest path algorithm with
complexity $\tilde O(n^{3/4}D^{1/4})$. For polylogarithmic $D$, this improves
on Elkin's $\tilde{O}(n^{5/6})$ bound and gets closer to the
$\tilde{\Omega}(n^{1/2})$ lower bound of Elkin [STOC'04]. For larger values of
$D$, we present an improved variant of our algorithm which achieves complexity
$\tilde{O}\left( n^{3/4+o(1)}+ \min\{ n^{3/4}D^{1/6},n^{6/7}\}+D\right)$, and
thus compares favorably with Elkin's bound of $\tilde{O}(n^{5/6} +
n^{2/3}D^{1/3} + D ) $ in essentially the entire range of parameters. This
algorithm provides also a qualitative improvement, because it works for the
more challenging case of directed graphs (i.e., graphs where the two directions
of an edge can have different weights), constituting the first sublinear-time
algorithm for directed graphs. Our algorithm also extends to the case of exact
$\kappa$-source shortest paths...

not have purely technical answers. For example, different algorithmic fairness
constraints are often impossible to satisfy simultaneously, and choosing
between them requires value judgments about which people may disagree.
Achieving consensus on algorithmic fairness will be difficult unless we
understand why people disagree in the first place. Here we use a series of
surveys to investigate how two factors affect disagreement: demographics and
discussion. First, we study whether disagreement on algorithmic fairness
questions is caused partially by differences in demographic backgrounds. This
is a question of interest because computer science is demographically
non-representative. If beliefs about algorithmic fairness correlate with
demographics, and algorithm designers are demographically non-representative,
decisions made about algorithmic fairness may not reflect the will of the
population as a whole. We show, using surveys of three separate populations,
that there are gender differences in beliefs about algorithmic fairness. For
example, women are less likely to favor including gender as a feature in an
algorithm which recommends courses to students if doing so would make female
students less likely to be recommended science courses. Second, we investigate
whether people's views on algorithmic fairness can be changed by discussion and
show, using longitudinal surveys of students in two computer science classes,
that they can.

Lagrangian submanifolds that can be disjoined from the isotropic skeleton of
the Weinstein manifold. Note that we do not need any additional assumptions on
this skeleton. By applying our generation result to the diagonal in the product
$W \times W$, we obtain as a corollary that the open-closed map from the
Hochschild homology of the wrapped Fukaya category of $W$ to its symplectic

organic layers. This treatment is particularly interesting to enable the
deposition from solution of
poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) on top of
the active layer of organic solar cells or photodetectors. However, oxygen is
known to be detrimental to organic devices, as the active layer is very
sensitive to oxygen and photo-oxidation. In this study, we aim to determine the
impact of oxygen plasma surface treatment on the performance of organic
photodetectors (OPD). We show a significant reduction of the sensitivity as
well as a change in the shape of the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the
device. Using hole density and conductivity measurements, we demonstrate the
p-doping of the active layer induced by oxygen plasma. Admittance spectroscopy
shows the formation of trap states approximately 350 meV above the highest
occupied molecular orbital of the active organic semiconductor layer. Numerical
simulations are carried out to understand the impact of p-doping and traps on
the electrical characteristics and performance of the OPDs.

public query interfaces. Recent academic work has demonstrated that malicious
users who can query such models are able to infer sensitive information about
records within the training data. Differential privacy can thwart such attacks,
but not all models can be readily trained to achieve this guarantee or to
achieve it with acceptable utility loss. As a result, if a model is trained
without differential privacy guarantee, little is known or can be said about
the privacy risk of releasing it. In this work, we investigate and analyze
membership attacks to understand why and how they succeed. Based on this
understanding, we propose Differential Training Privacy (DTP), an empirical
metric to estimate the privacy risk of publishing a classier when methods such
as differential privacy cannot be applied. DTP is a measure of a classier with
respect to its training dataset, and we show that calculating DTP is efficient
in many practical cases. We empirically validate DTP using state-of-the-art
machine learning models such as neural networks trained on real-world datasets.
Our results show that DTP is highly predictive of the success of membership
attacks and therefore reducing DTP also reduces the privacy risk. We advocate
for DTP to be used as part of the decision-making process when considering
publishing a classifier. To this end, we also suggest adopting the DTP-1
hypothesis: if a classifier has a DTP value above 1, it should not be
published.

inequal detunings. Similarly, a higher-order resonance shift exists appearing
as changes in both of the optical and mechanical resonances. We provide the
first known method to explicitly estimate the population of coherent phonons.
We also calculate corrections to spring effect due to higher-order interactions
and coherent phonons, and show that these corrections can be quite significant
in measurement of single-photon optomechanical interaction rate. It is shown
that there exists non-unique and various choices for the higher-order operators
to solve the optomechanical interaction with different multiplicative noise
terms, among which a minimal basis offers exactly linear Langevin equations,
while decoupling one Langevin equation and thus leaving the whole standard
optomechanical problem exactly solvable by explicit expressions. We finally
present a detailed treatment of multiplicative noise as well as nonlinear

solving complex optimization tasks in the course of tracking, experimental

orbital shrinkage due to angular momentum loss. Based on $(O-C)$ method, the
variation of the orbital period was studied using all the available times of
the minimum light. The $(O-C)$ diagram reveals that the period is increasing
continuously at a rate of $dP/dt=+2.09\times{10^{-7}}$days yr$^{-1}$, which can

Among the
spiral-triggering mechanisms proposed, only one establishes a causal link
between shadows and spirals so far. In fact, provided the presence of shadows
in the disc, the combined effect of temperature gradient and differential disc
rotation, creates strong azimuthal pressure gradients. After several thousand
years, grand-design spirals develop in the gas phase. Previous works have only
considered static shadows caused by an inclined inner disc. However, in some
cases, the inner regions of circumbinary discs can break and precess. Thus, it
is more realistic to consider moving shadow patterns in the disc. In this
configuration, the intersection between the inner and the outer discs defines
the line of nodes at which the shadows are cast. Here, we consider moving
shadows and study the resulting circumbinary disc structure. We find that only
static and prograde shadows trigger spirals, in contrast to retrograde ones.
Interestingly, if a region of the disc corotates with the shadow, a planet-like
signature develops at the co-rotation position. The resulting spirals resemble
those caused by a planet embedded in the disc, with similar pitch angles.

detection from a moving camera. Most existing techniques for drones involve
sending a video data streams back to a ground station with a high-end desktop
computer or server. These methods share one major drawback: data transmission
is subjected to considerable delay and possible corruption. Onboard computation
can not only overcome the data corruption problem but also increase the range
of motion. Unfortunately, due to limited weight-bearing capacity, equipping
drones with computing hardware of high processing capability is not feasible.
Therefore, developing a motion detection system with real-time performance and
high accuracy for drones with limited computing power is highly desirable. In
this paper, we propose a visual-inertial drone system for real-time motion
detection, namely REDBEE, that helps overcome challenges in shooting scenes
with strong parallax and dynamic background. REDBEE, which can run on the
state-of-the-art commercial low-power application processor (e.g. Snapdragon
Flight board used for our prototype drone), achieves real-time performance with
high detection accuracy. The REDBEE system overcomes obstacles in shooting
scenes with strong parallax through an inertial-aided dual-plane homography
estimation; it solves the issues in shooting scenes with dynamic background by
distinguishing the moving targets through a probabilistic model based on
spatial, temporal, and entropy consistency. The experiments are presented which
demonstrate that our system obtains greater accuracy when detecting moving
targets in outdoor environments than the state-of-the-art real-time onboard
detection systems.

path problem. For the approximation version of this problem, a $\tilde{O}(mn)$
time algorithm that computes a spanning tree of degree at most $\Delta^* +1$ is
previously known [F\""urer \& Raghavachari 1994]; here $\Delta^*$ denotes the
minimum tree degree of all the spanning trees. In this paper we give the first
near-linear time approximation algorithm for this problem. Specifically
speaking, we propose an $\tilde{O}(\frac{1}{\epsilon^7}m)$ time algorithm that
computes a spanning tree with tree degree $(1+\epsilon)\Delta^* +
O(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}\log n)$ for any constant $\epsilon \in (0,\frac{1}{6})$.
Thus, when $\Delta^*=\omega(\log n)$, we can achieve approximate solutions with

basic problems in the resource theory of coherence. While the usual coherence
measures are defined on a single system and cannot capture the nonlocal
correlation between subsystems, in order to deal with the distribution of
coherence it is crucial to quantify the coherence in bipartite systems
properly. Here, we introduce incoherent-quantum (IQ) coherence measures on
bipartite systems, which can characterize the correlations between systems.
According to the IQ coherence measures on bipartite systems, we find the
distribution of coherence of formation and assistance in bipartite systems: the
total coherence of formation is lower bounded by the sum of coherence of
formation in each subsystem and the entanglement of formation between the
subsystems, while the total coherence of assistance is upper bounded by the sum
of coherence of assistance in each subsystem and the entanglement of assistance
between subsystems. Besides, we also obtain the tradeoff relation between the
coherence cost and entanglement cost, distillable coherence and distillable
entanglement in bipartite systems. Thus, the IQ coherence measures introduced
here truly capture the nonlocal correlation between subsystems and reveal the
distribution of coherence in bipartite systems.

boundary range between the low- and high-spin states is expected to enrich the
transition and give rise to unusual physical states. However, no compound that
realizes a nearly degenerate critical range as the ground state without

This study reports that, by comprehensive measurements of macroscopic physical

in LaCoO$_3$ destabilizes its nonmagnetic low-spin state and generates an
anomalous paramagnetic state accompanied by the enhancement of transport gap

clean way to determine accurate black hole mass and the Hubble constant. An
important assumption made in using a Keplerian H2O maser disk for measuring the
black hole mass and the Hubble constant is that the disk mass is negligible
compared to the black hole mass. To test this assumption, a simple and useful
model can be found in Hure et al. (2011). In this work, the authors apply a
linear disk model to a position-dynamical mass diagram and re-analyze
position-velocity data from H2O maser disks associated with active galactic
nuclei. They claim that a maser disk with nearly perfect Keplerian rotation
could have disk mass comparable to the black hole mass. This would imply that
ignoring the effects of disk self-gravity can lead to large systematic errors
in the measurement of black hole mass and the Hubble constant. We examine their
methods and find that their large estimated disk masses of Keplerian disks are
likely the result of their use of projected instead of 3-dimensional position
and velocity information. To place better constraints on the disk masses of
Keplerian maser systems, we incorporate disk self-gravity into a 3-dimensional
Bayesian modelling program for maser disks and also evaluate constraints based
on the physical conditions for disks which support water maser emission. We
find that there is little evidence that disk masses are dynamically important
at the ~<1% level compared to the black holes.

bow shock of Earth is a piston shock. Behind the bow shock front there is a
flow of the modified solar wind plasma: transition layer, which also carries
the modified magnetic field of solar wind. Velocity and density of plasma as
well as parameters of magnetic field of this current can be estimated if the

determined potential distribution along magnetopause from the balance condition
of substance coming into transition layer from the solar wind on one side and
leaving through the gap between magnetosphere and the bow shock front and
through magnetopause on another. To a first approximation this distribution
differs from potential distribution at the BS front only in a constant

key idea in our attack is to search over latent code pairs to find ones that

attack is stronger than searching over perturbations of real images. Moreover,
we show that our stronger attack can be used to reduce the accuracy of
Defense-GAN to 3\%, resolving an open problem from the well-known paper by
Athalye et al. We combine our attack with normal adversarial training to obtain
the most robust known MNIST classifier, significantly improving the state of
the art against PGD attacks. Our formulation involves solving a min-max

introduced in Davis (1984). Many models in insurance mathematics can be
formulated in terms of the general concept of piecewise deterministic Markov
processes. In this context, one is interested in computing certain quantities
of interest such as the probability of ruin of an insurance company, or the
insurance company's value, defined as the expected discounted future dividend
payments until the time of ruin. Instead of explicitly solving the
integro-(partial) differential equation related to the quantity of interest
considered (an approach which can only be used in few special cases), we adapt
the problem in a manner that allows us to apply deterministic numerical
integration algorithms such as quasi-Monte Carlo rules; this is in contrast to
applying random integration algorithms such as Monte Carlo. To this end, we
reformulate a general cost functional as a fixed point of a particular integral
operator, which allows for iterative approximation of the functional.
Furthermore, we introduce a smoothing technique which is applied to the
integrands involved, in order to use error bounds for deterministic cubature
rules. On the analytical side, we prove a convergence result for our PDMP
approximation, which is of independent interest as it justifies phase-type
approximations on the process level. We illustrate the smoothing technique for
a risk-theoretic example, and provide a comparative study of deterministic and
Monte Carlo integration.

Superschool on Derived Categories and D-branes. The goal is to outline an
identification of the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on a
Calabi-Yau threefold with the D-brane category in B-model topological string
theory. This was originally conjectured by Kontsevich. We begin by briefly
introducing topological closed string theory to acquaint the reader with the
basics of the non-linear sigma model. With the inclusion of open strings, we
must specify boundary conditions for the endpoints; these are what we call
D-branes. After briefly summarizing the necessary homological algebra and sheaf
cohomology, we argue that one should think of a D-brane as a complex of
coherent sheaves, and provide a physical motivation to identify complexes up to
homotopy. Finally, we argue that renormalization group (RG) flow on the
worldsheet provides a physical realization of quasi-isomorphism. This
identifies a stable object in the derived category with a universality class of
D-branes in physics. I aim for this article to be an approachable introduction
to the subject for both mathematicians and physicists. As such, it is far from

dominant chaotic projections causes the chaotic trajectories to become stable

address this question by analysing some recently published data of alien plants

well as the agricultural and artificial land cover types richness (as
indicators of human presence) as independent variables. In addition, the
spatial cross-correlation between the percentage of protected area and alien
species richness was examined across scales. Results indicated that the
percentage of protected area per cell is a poor predictor of alien species
richness. Spatial analysis indicated that cells with higher percentage of
protected areas have slightly less alien species than cells with lower
percentage of protected areas. This result is likely to be driven by the
overall negative correlation between habitat protection and anthropogenic
activities. Thus, the conclusions deduced by data deriving from protected areas
are likely to hold true for patterns of alien species in non-protected areas

the lifetime $T_{1}$ of the excited state. However, when the observation time
$T$ is short or comparable to $T_{1}$, the frequency spectrum is appreciably

imagery collections, and extend the per-pixel classification to robustly create
a consistent 2D classification which can be used to fill the gaps in non-

a finite volume for a given magnetic field which however required the flux to
be balanced separately on all the sides of the considered volume. In order to
allow finite magnetic fluxes through the boundaries, a Coulomb gauge is
constructed that allows for global magnetic flux balance. We tested and
verified our method in a theoretical fore-free magnetic field model. We apply
the new method to the former calculation data and found a difference of less
than 1.2\%. We also applied our method to the magnetic field above active
region NOAA 11429 obtained by a new photospheric-data-driven MHD model code
GOEMHD3. We analyzed the magnetic helicity evolution in the solar corona using
our new method. It was found that the normalized magnetic helicityis equal to
-0.038 when fast magnetic reconnection is triggered. This value is comparable
to the previous value (-0.029) in the MHD simulations when magnetic
reconnection happened and the observed normalized magnetic helicity (-0.036)
from the eruption of newly emerging active regions. We found that only 8\% of
the accumulated magnetic helicity is dissipated after it is injected through
the bottom boundary. This is in accordance with the Woltjer conjecture. Only
2\% of magnetic helicity injected from the bottom boundary escapes through the
corona. This is consistent with the observation of magnetic clouds, which could
take away magnetic helicity into the interplanetary space, in the case
considered here, several halo CMEs and two X-class solar flares origin from

gravitational radiation reaction force) in rotating stars. In the absence of a
magnetic field, gravitational radiation exponentially increases the r-mode
amplitude $\alpha$, and accelerates differential rotation (secular motion of
fluid elements). For a magnetized star, differential rotation enhances the
magnetic field energy. Rezzolla et al. (2000--2001) argued that if the magnetic
energy grows faster than the gravitational radiation reaction force pumps
energy into the r-modes, then the r-mode instability is suppressed. Chugunov
(2015) demonstrated that without gravitational radiation, differential rotation
can be treated as a degree of freedom decoupled from the r-modes and controlled
by the back reaction of the magnetic field. In particular, the magnetic field
windup does not damp r-modes. Here we discuss the effect of the back reaction
of the magnetic field on differential rotation of unstable r-modes, and show
that it limits the generated magnetic field and the magnetic energy growth rate
preventing suppression of the r-mode instability by magnetic windup at low
saturation amplitudes, $\alpha \ll 1$, predicted by current models.

Fitzpatrick (1999) families, so it should be preferentially used. In many cases
O stars and late-type stars experience similar amounts of extinction at similar
distances but some O stars are located close to the molecular clouds left over
from their births and have larger extinctions than the average for nearby
late-type populations. In qualitative terms, O stars experience a more diverse
extinction than late-type stars, as some are affected by the small-grain-size,
low-R_5495 effect of molecular clouds and others by the large-grain-size,
high-R_5495 effect of H II regions. Late-type stars experience a narrower range
of grain sizes or R_5495, as their extinction is predominantly caused by the
average, diffuse ISM. We propose that the reason for the existence of
large-grain-size, high-R_5495 regions in the ISM in the form of H II regions
and hot-gas bubbles is the selective destruction of small dust grains by EUV
photons and possibly by thermal sputtering by atoms or ions.

Particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate that these fields significantly
enhance the radiation rates of the laser-irradiated electrons, and furthermore
they collimate the emission so that a directed and dense beam of multi-MeV
gamma-rays is achievable. This capability can be exploited for
electron-positron pair production via the linear Breit-Wheeler process by
colliding two such dense beams. Presented simulations show that more than
$10^3$ pairs can be produced in such a setup, and the directionality of the

topological features emerge at different energy bands separated by large gaps.
The topology manifests in the way the particles organize in real space to form
states with different energy. Each of these states contains topological
defects/condensations whose Euler characteristic can be used as a topological
number to categorize states belonging to the same energy band. We provide
analytical formulas for this topological number and the full energy spectrum of
the system for both sparsely and densely filled systems. Furthermore, we
analyze the connection with the Gauss-Bonnet theorem of differential geometry,
by using the curvature generated in real space by the particle structures. Our

emerge in strongly interacting many-body systems following simple underlying
rules, without considering the spin, long-range microscopic interactions, or

different Majorana edge modes separated in the time lattice can be braided,

applied also to indirect testing of transmission profiles of other Lyot

Solaires (THEMIS) in the He I 5876 A (He I D3) multiplet aiming to measure the
spectral characteristics of the He I D3 profiles and to find for them an
adequate fitting model. The component characteristics of the He I D3 Stokes I
profiles are measured by the fitting system approximating them with a double
Gaussian. This model yields an He I D3 component peak intensity ratio of
$5.5\pm0.4$, which differs from the value of 8 expected in the optically thin
limit. Most of the measured Doppler velocities lie in the interval $\pm5$ km/s,
with a standard deviation of $\pm1.7$ km/s around the peak value of 0.4 km/s.
The wide distribution of the full-width at half maximum has two maxima at 0.25
A and 0.30 A for the He I D3 blue component and two maxima at 0.22 A and 0.31 A
for the red component. The width ratio of the components is $1.04\pm0.18$. We
show that the double-Gaussian model systematically underestimates the blue wing
intensities. To solve this problem, we invoke a two-temperature multi-Gaussian
model, consisting of two double-Gaussians, which provides a better
representation of He I D3 that is free of the wing intensity deficit. This
model suggests temperatures of 11.5 kK and 91 kK, respectively, for the cool

a typical He I D3 profile have component peak intensity ratios of 6.6 and 8,
implying a prominence geometrical width of 17 Mm and an optical thickness of
0.3 for the cool component, while the optical thickness of the hot component is
negligible. These prominence parameters seem to be realistic, suggesting the
physical adequacy of the multi-Gaussian model with important implications for
interpreting He I D3 spectropolarimetry by current inversion codes.

sufficiently dispersive $abcd$ systems (characterized only in terms of

We prove this result by constructing three suitable virial functionals in the

notions of participational equilibria that exist in such interactions that
permit public defections. We compare Intention Games with conventional

Intention Games. In a partially honest setting, we give Intention Game
instances of a Cournot competition, secure interactions between mobile

of X-ray binaries (XRBs), and are switched off in the thermal state, but they
appear to be present in both low-luminosity and luminous active galactic nuclei
(AGNs). It is widely believed that strong large-scale magnetic fields is a
crucial ingredient in jet production; such fields can be attained only through
efficient advection from the outer disc. We suggest that geometrically thin
accretion discs with magnetic outflows are present in luminous radio-loud AGNs;
this is likely because the interstellar medium provides both mass and
sufficient magnetic flux to the outer disc. Most angular momentum of such disc
is removed by the outflows, and the radial velocity of the disc is
significantly increased compared to viscous drift velocity. This facilitates
efficient magnetic field advection through the disc to produce a strong field
near the black hole in luminous AGNs, which helps launch relativistic jets. In
XRBs, the magnetic fields of the gas from companion stars are too weak to drive
outflows from outer discs. Jets are therefore switched off in the thermal state
due to inefficient magnetic field advection in the disc.

with a far reaching strong homotopy generalization of Manin triples type
constructions.
  The homotopy theory of multi-oriented props can be quite non-trivial (and
different from that of ordinary props). The famous Grothendieck-Teichm\""uller
group acts faithfully as homotopy non-trivial automorphisms on infinitely many
multi-oriented props, a fact which motivated much the present work as it gives
us a hint to a non-trivial deformation quantization theory in every geometric
dimension $d\geq 4$ generalizing to higher dimensions
Drinfeld-Etingof-Kazhdan's quantizations of Lie bialgebras (the case $d=3$) and
Kontsevich's quantizations of Poisson structures (the case $d=2$).

extrapolation [Li2017,Temme2017] and quasi-probability decomposition
[Temme2017]. To enable practical implementation of these ideas, here we account
for the inevitable imperfections in the experimentalist's knowledge of the
error model itself. We describe a protocol for systematically measuring the
effect of errors so as to design efficient QEM circuits. We find that the
effect of localised Markovian errors can be fully eliminated by inserting or
replacing some gates with certain single-qubit Clifford gates and measurements.
Finally, having introduced an exponential variant of the extrapolation method
we contrast the QEM techniques using exact numerical simulation of up to 19
qubits in the context of a `SWAP test' circuit. Our optimised methods
dramatically reduce the circuit's output error without increasing the qubit
count or time requirements.

$s_{\pm}$ state (which favors phase anti locking) and the $s_{++}$ state (which
favors phase locking). We discuss here that the situation can be much more
complex in the presence of an external field or superconducting currents. In an
external applied magnetic field, dirty two-band superconductors do not feature
a sharp $s_{\pm}\to s_{++}$ crossover but rather a washed-out crossover to a
finite region in the parameter space where both $s_{\pm}$ and $s_{++}$ states
can coexist for example as a lattice or a microemulsion of inclusions of
different states. The current-carrying regions such as the regions near vortex
cores can exhibit an $s_\pm$ state while it is the $s_{++}$ state that is
favored in the bulk. This coexistence of both states can even be realized in
the Meissner state at the domain's boundaries featuring Meissner currents. We

destructive effects on native biodiversity, agriculture, and public health.
This ant's aggressive foraging behaviour and high reproductive capability have
enabled its establishment of wild populations in most regions into which it has
been imported. An important aspect of eradication is thorough nest monitoring
and destruction during early invasion to prevent range expansion. The question
is: How intense must monitoring be on temporal and spatial scales to eradicate
the fire ant? Assuming that the ant was introduced into a region and that
monitoring was conducted immediately after nest detection in an effort to
detect all other potentially established nests, we developed a mathematical
model to investigate detection rates. Setting the monitoring limit to three
years, the detection rate was maximized when monitoring was conducted shifting
bait trap locations and setting them at intervals of 30 m for each monitoring.
Monitoring should be conducted in a radius of at least 4 km around the source
nest, or wider --depending on how late a nest is found. For ease of
application, we also derived equations for finding the minimum bait interval
required in an arbitrary ant species for thorough monitoring.

space. However, despite previous efforts to find good prototypes, how to select
the best representation set remains an open issue. In this paper we proposed
scalable methods to select the set of prototypes out of very large datasets.
The methods are based on genetic algorithms, dissimilarity-based hashing, and
two different unsupervised and supervised scalable criteria. The unsupervised
criterion is based on the Minimum Spanning Tree of the graph created by the
prototypes as nodes and the dissimilarities as edges. The supervised criterion
is based on counting matching labels of objects and their closest prototypes.
The suitability of these type of algorithms is analyzed for the specific case

produced at a high energy collider showers and hadronize to a cluster of dark
mesons. Dark mesons then decay to visible particles and produce a jet-like
signal, which is called ""dark jet"" in this work. Collider signal of dark jet
depends on the property of dark mesons. For example, a finite lifetime of dark
meson would provide displaced vertex or displaced track, thus one can use these
displaced objects to tag dark jet. However if the lifetime of dark meson is
collider-negligible (too short to manifest a displaced vertex), it would be
difficult to distinguish a dark jet from SM QCD jets. In this work we propose a
new tagging strategy to identify dark jets from QCD backgrounds. This strategy
is based on jet-substructure analysis. We study various jet-substructure
variables and find out variables with good discrimination ability. Our result
shows that by combining multiple jet-substructure variables, one could
distinguish dark jets from QCD background, and thus enhance the sensitivity of
dark sector search at collider.

  the development of quantitative OR papers over a period of 25 years",,,,,"math.HO math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This short paper aims to investigate some of the historical developments of
one classic, well-cited and highly esteemed scientific journal in the domain of
quantitative operations research - namely the INFORMS journal Operations
Research - over a period of 25 years between 1981 and 2006. As such this paper,
and the journal in question, represents one representative attempt to analyze -
for the purpose of possible future generalization - how research production has
evolved, and evolves, over time. Among the general developments that we think
we can trace are that (a) the historical overviews (i.e., literature surveys)
in the articles, as well as the list of references, somewhat
counter-intuitively shrink over time, while (b) the motivating and modelling
parts grow. We also attempt to characterize - in some detail - the appearance
and character, over time, of the most cited, as well as the least cited, papers
over the years studied. In particular, we find that many of the least cited
papers are quite imbalanced. For example, some of them include one main section
only, and the least cited papers also have shorter reference lists.
  We also analyse the articles' utilization of important buzz words
representing the constitutive parts of an OR journal paper, based on Subben's
checklist (Larsson and Patriksson, 2014, 2016). Based on a word count of these
buzz words we conclude through a citation study, utilizing a collection of
particularly highly or little cited papers, that there is a quite strong
positive correlation between a journal paper being highly cited and its degree
of utilization of this checklist.

Using the observed radio continuum flux of the H II regions, the derived
spectral types of the ionizing sources agree well with the previously reported
results. The S53 complex harbors clusters of young stellar objects (YSOs) that
are identified using the photometric 2--24 $\mu$m magnitudes. It also hosts
several massive condensations (3000-30000 $M_\odot$) which are traced in the

evident in the velocity space of the $^{13}$CO data. Together, the S53 complex

index parameter, $\gamma$. From these observed parameters, one can reconstruct
the model functions in scalar tensor gravity theories. However, there is a long
standing debate about the (in)equality between conformally transformed frames
in scalar tensor gravity models. We show that cosmological observables are
frame dependent when they are described by frame independent parameter,
redshift. Thus, if the cosmological observables are interpreted in one frame,
then all of the observables should also be interpreted in that frame. This
explicitly shows the conformal inequality of cosmological observables. Also,
our method provides the model independent analysis for STG models about various

intelligent transportation systems have received significant recent attention.
In this paper, we minimize the age of a single information flow in
interference-free multihop networks. When preemption is allowed and the packet
transmission times are exponentially distributed, we prove that a preemptive
Last-Generated, First-Served (LGFS) policy results in smaller age processes
across all nodes in the network than any other causal policy (in a stochastic
ordering sense). In addition, for the class of New-Better-than-Used (NBU)
distributions, we show that the non-preemptive LGFS policy is within a constant
age gap from the optimum average age. In contrast, our numerical result shows
that the preemptive LGFS policy can be very far from the optimum for some NBU
transmission time distributions. Finally, when preemption is prohibited and the
packet transmission times are arbitrarily distributed, the non-preemptive LGFS
policy is shown to minimize the age processes across all nodes in the network
among all work-conserving policies (again in a stochastic ordering sense).
Interestingly, these results hold under quite general conditions, including (i)
arbitrary packet generation and arrival times, and (ii) for minimizing both the
age processes in stochastic ordering and any non-decreasing functional of the
age processes.

fitting method Vakili and Hogg (2016). And we apply FPF method to estimate the
centroid in real space, this scatter reduces to $\sim$0.04 in SNR=200 CFHT like

dominates the shifting of the centroid, therefore the scatter estimated from
different methods are similar. We compare polynomial fitting and FPF using
GalSim simulation with optical anisotropy. We find that in all SNR$\sim$50, 100
