semantic embedding space to transfer the knowledge from the seen classes to
unseen ones. Capturing the common semantic characteristics between the visual
modality and the class semantic modality (e.g., attributes or word vector) is a
key to the success of ZSL. In this paper, we propose a novel encoder-decoder
approach, namely Latent Space Encoding (LSE), to connect the semantic relations
of different modalities. Instead of requiring a projection function to transfer
information across different modalities like most previous work, LSE per- forms
the interactions of different modalities via a feature aware latent space,
which is learned in an implicit way. Specifically, different modalities are
modeled separately but optimized jointly. For each modality, an encoder-decoder
framework is performed to learn a feature aware latent space via jointly
maximizing the recoverability of the original space from the latent space and
the predictability of the latent space from the original space. To relate
different modalities together, their features referring to the same concept are
enforced to share the same latent codings. In this way, the common semantic
characteristics of different modalities are generalized with the latent
representations. Another property of the proposed approach is that it is easily
extended to more modalities. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark
datasets (AwA, CUB, aPY, and ImageNet) clearly demonstrate the superiority of
the proposed approach on several ZSL tasks, including traditional ZSL,
generalized ZSL, and zero-shot retrieval (ZSR).

most general sense, a function is intensional if it operates at a level finer
than (extensional) equality. This is a familiar setting for computer
scientists, who often study different programs or processes that are
interchangeable, i.e. extensionally equal, even though they are not implemented
in the same way, so intensionally distinct. Concomitant with intensionality is
the phenomenon of intensional recursion, which refers to the ability of a
program to have access to its own code. In computability theory, intensional
recursion is enabled by Kleene's Second Recursion Theorem. This thesis is
concerned with the crafting of a logical toolkit through which these phenomena
can be studied. Our main contribution is a framework in which mathematical and
computational constructions can be considered either extensionally, i.e. as

II$_\infty$, depending on whether the spectrum of the category is finite or
infinite) or they can be of type III$_\lambda$, $\lambda\in (0,1]$. The choice
of type is tuned by the choice of Tomita structure (defined in the paper) on
certain bimodules we use in the construction. Moreover, if the spectrum is
infinite we realize the whole tensor category directly as endomorphisms of
these algebras, with finite Jones index, by exhibiting a fully faithful unitary
tensor functor $F:\mathscr{C} \hookrightarrow End_0(\Phi)$ where $\Phi$ is a
factor (of type II or III).
  The construction relies on methods from free probability (full Fock space,
amalgamated free products), it does not depend on amenability assumptions, and
it can be applied to categories with uncountable spectrum (hence it provides an
alternative answer to a conjecture of Yamagami \cite{Y3}). Even in the case of
uncountably generated categories, we can refine the previous equivalence to
obtain realizations on $\sigma$-finite factors as endomorphisms (in the type
III case) and as bimodules (in the type II case).
  In the case of trivial Tomita structure, we recover the same algebra obtained
in \cite{PopaS} and \cite{AMD}, namely the (countably generated) free group
factor $L(F_\infty)$ if the given category has denumerable spectrum, while we
get the free group factor with uncountably many generators if the spectrum is

faces of $Q$ to be covered multiple times. First, we define a variety of
folding models according to whether the folds (a) must be along grid lines of
$P$ or can divide squares in half (diagonally and/or orthogonally), (b) must be
mountain or can be both mountain and valley, (c) can remain flat (forming an
angle of $180^\circ$), and (d) must lie on just the polycube surface or can
have interior faces as well. Second, we give all the inclusion relations among
all models that fold on the grid lines of $P$. Third, we characterize all
polyominoes that can fold into a unit cube, in some models. Fourth, we give a
linear-time dynamic programming algorithm to fold a tree-shaped polyomino into
a constant-size polycube, in some models. Finally, we consider the triangular
version of the problem, characterizing which polyiamonds fold into a regular
tetrahedron.

conjungate function of the supremun function over an arbitrary family of
functions. The work is principally motivated by the case when data functions
are lower semicontinuous proper and convex. Nevertheless, we explore the case
when the family of functions is arbitrary, but satisfying that the biconjugate
of the supremum functions is equal to the supremum of the biconjugate of the
data functions. The study focuses its attention on functions defined in
finite-dimensional spaces, in this case the formulae can be simplified under
certain qualification conditions. However, we show how to extend these results
to arbitrary locally convex spaces without any qualification condition.

relativistic narrowly collimated jet ejected in a supernova explosion and
viewed from a far off-axis angle. As such, VLA/VLBI follow-up radio
observations of a superluminal displacement of its bright radio afterglow from
its parent supernova, will be able to test clearly whether it is an ordinary

which are different from ordinary GRBs, and cannot be explained by standard

condensate at finite temperature within the Polyakov-loop improved NJL model.
To this end we treat quark-antiquark correlations in the pion channel (bound
states and scattering continuum) within a Beth-Uhlenbeck approach that uses
medium-dependent phase shifts. A striking medium effect is the Mott transition
which occurs when the binding energy vanishes and the discrete pion bound state
merges the continuum. This transition is triggered by the lowering of the
continuum edge due to the chiral restoration transition. This in turn also
entails a modification of the Polyakov-loop so that the SU(3) center symmetry
gets broken at finite temperature and dynamical quarks (and gluons) appear in
the system, taking over the role of the dominant degrees of freedom from the
pions. At low temperatures our model reproduces the chiral perturbation theory
result for the chiral condensate while at high temperatures the PNJL model
result is recovered. The new aspect of the current work is a consistent
treatment of the chiral restoration transition region within the Beth-Uhlenbeck
approach on the basis of mesonic phase shifts for the treatment of the
correlations.

island of Lanzarote, in the Canarian archipelago, built prior to 1810, as well
as a few buildings of later times, which represent a nearly complete sample of
all the island's Christian sanctuaries. Our study indicates that a definite
orientation pattern was followed on the island but, unlike what is often found
in most of the Christian world, it has two interpretations. On the one hand,
the representative orientation to the east (or west) is present. However, the
sample has also a marked orientation towards north-northeast which is, as far
as we know, a pattern exclusive to Lanzarote. We discuss the reasons for this
pattern and suggest that one possible explanation could be a rather prosaic
one, namely, that sometimes needs of everyday life are more relevant than --and
push individuals to make decisions at odds with-- religious beliefs. This work
is the beginning of the first systematic archaeoastronomical study ever
conducted with old churches in the Canary Islands [abridged].

the sky between interstellar magnetic fields and filaments hosting cold clumps.
For the first time, we consider both the density of the environment and the
density contrast between the filaments and their environment. Moreover, we
geometrically distinguish between the clumps and the remaining portions of the
filaments. We infer the magnetic field orientations in the filaments and in
their environment from the Stokes parameters, assuming optically thin
conditions. Thus, we analyze the relative orientations between filaments,
embedded clumps, and internal and background magnetic fields, depending on the
filament environment and evolutionary stages. We recover the previously
observed trend for filaments in low column density environments to be aligned
parallel to the background magnetic field; however, we find that this trend is
significant only for low contrast filaments, whereas high contrast filaments
tend to be randomly orientated with respect to the background magnetic field.
Filaments in high column density environments do not globally show any
preferential orientation, although low contrast filaments alone tend to have
perpendicular relative orientation with respect to the background magnetic
field. For a subsample of nearby filaments, for which volume densities can be
derived, we find a clear transition in the relative orientation with increasing
density, at $n_{\rm H} \sim 10^{3}~{\rm cm}^{-3}$, changing from mostly
parallel to mostly perpendicular in the off-clump portions of filaments and
from even to bimodal in the clumps. Our results confirm a strong interplay
between interstellar magnetic fields and filaments during their formation and
evolution.

hypersurface as the holographic screen in the flat bulk. After adding the
baryonic matter on the screen, we assume that both of the dark matter and dark
energy can be described by the Brown-York stress-energy tensor. From the
Hamiltonian constraint equation in the flat bulk, we find an interesting
relation between the dark matter and baryonic matter's energy density
parameters, by comparing with the Lambda cold dark matter parameterization. We
further compare this holographic embedding of emergent dark matter with
traditional braneworld scenario and present an alternative interpretation as
the holographic universe. It can be reduced to our toy constraint in the late
time universe, with the new parameterization of the Friedmann equation. We also
comment on the possible connection with Verlinde's emergent gravity, where the
dark matter is treated as the elastic response of the baryonic matter on the de
Sitter spacetime background. We show that from the holographic de Sitter model
with elasticity, the Tully-Fisher relation and the dark matter distribution in
the galaxy scale can be derived.

the critical values $\xi_c^{(n)} = n/ ( \rho(r_s)\,\kappa )$, with $n \in
\mathbb{N}$ and $\rho(r_s)$ the metric's profile function at the position of
the shell, for which the scalar field is divergent in the background
configuration. The pathological behavior is removed by restricting the coupling
to a domain of stability. The coupling has a significant influence over the
self-force at the vicinities of the shell, and we identified $\xi=1/4$ as the
value for which the scalar force changes sign at a neighborhood of $r_s$; if
$\kappa (1-4\xi)>0$ the shell acts repulsively as an effective potential
barrier, while if $\kappa (1-4\xi)<0$ it attracts the charge as a potential
well. The sign of the asymptotic self-force only depends on whether there is an
angle deficit or not on the external region where the charge is placed; conical
asymptotics produce a leading attractive force, while Minkowski regions produce
a repulsive asymptotic self-force.

wavelengths much greater than the ion inertial length under the assumption that
slow magnetosonic waves are strongly damped. It is shown analytically that the
parametric instability leads to an inverse cascade of Alfv\'en wave quanta, and
several exact solutions to the wave kinetic equations are presented. The main
results of the paper concern the parametric decay of Alfv\'en waves that
initially satisfy $e^+ \gg e^-$, where $e^+$ and $e^-$ are the frequency
($\,f$) spectra of Alfv\'en waves propagating in opposite directions along the
magnetic field lines. If $e^+$ initially has a peak frequency $f_0$ (at which
$f e^+$ is maximized) and an ""infrared"" scaling $f^p$ at smaller $f$ with $-1 <
p < 1$, then $e^+$ acquires an $f^{-1}$ scaling throughout a range of
frequencies that spreads out in both directions from $f_0$. At the same time,
$e^-$ acquires an $f^{-2}$ scaling within this same frequency range. If the
plasma parameters and infrared $e^+$ spectrum are chosen to match conditions in
the fast solar wind at a heliocentric distance of 0.3 astronomical units (AU),
then the nonlinear evolution of the parametric instability leads to an $e^+$
spectrum that matches fast-wind measurements from the Helios spacecraft at 0.3
AU, including the observed $f^{-1}$ scaling at $f \gtrsim 3 \times 10^{-4}
\mbox{ Hz}$. The results of this paper suggest that the $f^{-1}$ spectrum seen
by Helios in the fast solar wind at $f \gtrsim 3\times 10^{-4} \mbox{ Hz}$ is
produced in situ by parametric decay and that the $f^{-1}$ range of $e^+$
extends over an increasingly narrow range of frequencies as $r$ decreases below
0.3 AU. This prediction will be tested by measurements from the Parker Solar
Probe.

access to $\langle O_1 O_2 \rangle$. This problem is relevant for the study of
localized quantum information in gravity since the set of approximately-local
operators in a region may not be closed under arbitrary products. While we
cannot naturally associate a density matrix with a state in this setting, it is
still possible to define a modular operator for a state, and distinguish
between two states using a relative modular operator. These operators are
defined on a little Hilbert space, which parameterizes small deformations of
the system away from its original state, and they do not depend on the
structure of the full Hilbert space of the theory. We extract a class of

measure the distance between states, are monotonic under contractions of the
set of available observables, and vanish only when the states are equal.

component in applications exploiting quantum physics such as quantum
communication and cryptography. Realistic sources are inherently noisy, cannot
run for an infinitely long time, and do not necessarily behave in an
independent and identically distributed manner. An important question then
arises -- how can one test, or certify, that a realistic source produces high
amounts of entanglement? Crucially, a meaningful and operational solution
should allow us to certify the entanglement which is available for further
applications after performing the test itself (in contrast to assuming the
availability of an additional source which can produce more entangled states,
identical to those which were tested). To answer the above question and lower
bound the amount of entanglement produced by an uncharacterised source, we
present a protocol that can be run by interacting classically with
uncharacterised (but not entangled to one another) measurement devices used to
measure the states produced by the source. A successful run of the protocol
implies that the remaining quantum state has high amounts of one-shot
distillable entanglement. That is, one can distill many maximally entangled
states out of the single remaining state. Importantly, our protocol can
tolerate noise and, thus, certify entanglement produced by realistic sources.
With the above properties, the protocol acts as the first ""operational
device-independent entanglement certification protocol"" and allows one to test
and benchmark uncharacterised entanglement sources which may be otherwise
incomparable.

optimizing the bound's prior, violating the hypothesis of the PAC-Bayes theorem
that the prior is chosen independently of the data. Indeed, available

reaches stationarity. In particular, Entropy-SGLD can be configured to yield
relatively tight generalization bounds and still fit real labels, although

The N\'eel temperature of CeCoAl$_4$ is $T_N$=13.5K and a metamagnetic-like
transition occurs in the magnetic field of about 7.5T. We show that the
magnetic contribution to the thermoelectric power, $S_f(T)$, exhibits a large
peak due to the crystal electric field (CEF) at about 240K and a small anomaly
around the ordering temperature. Surprisingly, the CEF related $S_f(T)$ peak is
close to the upper CEF excitation energy $\Delta_2$=202K, in contrast to the
usual case of the peak position being a fraction of the real CEF excitation.
The applicability of different theoretical and phenomenological models

synchronous stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and identify causes of scaling
inefficiency at higher node counts. To our knowledge, this is the first
exploration of distributed GRPC Tensorflow scalability on a HPC supercomputer
at such large scale with synchronous SGD. We studied scaling of two convolution
neural networks - ResNet-50, a state-of-the-art deep network for classification
with roughly 25.5 million parameters, and HEP-CNN, a shallow topology with less
than 1 million parameters for common scientific usages. For ResNet-50, we
achieve >80% scaling efficiency on up to 128 workers, using 32 parameter
servers (PS tasks) with a steep decline down to 23% for 512 workers using 64 PS
tasks. Our analysis of the efficiency drop points to low network bandwidth
utilization due to combined effect of three factors. (a) Heterogeneous
distributed parallelization algorithm which uses PS tasks as centralized
servers for gradient averaging is suboptimal for utilizing interconnect
bandwidth. (b) Load imbalance among PS tasks hinders their efficient scaling.
(c) Underlying communication primitive GRPC is currently inefficient on Cori
high-speed interconnect. The HEP-CNN demands less interconnect bandwidth, and
shows >80% weak scaling efficiency for up to 256 nodes with only 1 PS task. Our
findings are applicable to other deep learning networks. Big networks with
millions of parameters stumble upon the issues discussed here. Shallower
networks like HEP-CNN with relatively lower number of parameters can
efficiently enjoy weak scaling even with a single parameter server.

There
exist two main candidates: a fast-rotating black hole and a rapidly spinning
magnetar. Furthermore, the X-ray plateaus are widely accepted by the energy
injection into the external shock. In this paper, we systematically analyze the
\emph{Swift}/XRT light curves of 101 GRBs having plateau phases and known
redshifts (before May 2017). Since a maximum energy budget
($\sim2\times10^{52}$ erg) exists for magnetars but not for a black hole, this
provides a good clue to identify the type of GRB central engine. We calculate
the isotropic kinetic energy $E_{\rm K,iso}$ and the isotropic X-ray energy
release $E_{\rm X,iso}$ for individual GRB. We identify three categories based
on how likely a black hole harbor at central engine: 'Gold' (9 out of 101, both
$E_{\rm X,iso}$ and $E_{\rm K,iso}$ exceed the energy budget), 'Silver' (69 out
of 101, $E_{\rm X,iso}$ less than the limit but $E_{\rm K,iso}$ is greater than
the limit), and 'Bronze' (23 out of 101, the energies are not above the limit).
We then derive and test the black hole parameters with the Blandford Znajek
mechanism, and find that the observations of the black hole candidate
('Gold'+'Silver') samples are consistent with the expectations of the black
hole model. Furthermore, we also test the magnetar candidate ('Bronze') sample
with the magnetar model, and find that the magnetar surface magnetic led
($B_{p}$) and initial spin period ($P_{0}$) are consistent with the
expectations of the magnetar model. Our analysis indicates that, if the
magnetar wind is isotropic, a magnetar central engine is possible for 20\% of
the analyzed GRBs. For most GRBs a black hole is most likely operating.

In this paper, we develop declarative rules which govern the translation of

present a framework for incorporating such declarative knowledge into word
problem solving. Our method learns to map arithmetic word problem text to math
expressions, by learning to select the relevant declarative knowledge for each
operation of the solution expression. This provides a way to handle multiple
concepts in the same problem while, at the same time, support interpretability
of the answer expression. Our method models the mapping to declarative
knowledge as a latent variable, thus removing the need for expensive

realistic case where the training data it is exposed to is biased in a

to the motion of a probe membrane propagating in the background of a spacetime
that solves Einstein's equations. The equation of motion of this membrane is
determined by the membrane stress tensor. In this paper we `improve' the
membrane stress tensor derived in earlier work to ensure that it defines
consistent probe membrane dynamics even at finite $D$ while reducing to
previous results at large D. Our improved stress tensor is the sum of a Brown
York term and a fluid energy momentum tensor. The fluid has an unusual equation
of state; its pressure is nontrivial but its energy density vanishes. We
demonstrate that all stationary solutions of our membrane equations are
produced by the extremisation of an action functional of the membrane shape.
Our action is an offshell generalization of the membrane's thermodynamical
partition function. We demonstrate that the thermodynamics of static spherical
membranes in flat space and global AdS space exactly reproduces the
thermodynamics of the dual Schwarzschild black holes even at finite D. We study
the long wavelength dynamics of membranes in AdS space, and demonstrate that
the boundary `shadow' of this membrane dynamics is boundary hydrodynamics with
with a definite constitutive relation. We determine the explicit form of shadow
dual boundary stress tensor upto second order in derivatives of the boundary
temperature and velocity, and verify that this stress tensor agrees exactly
with the fluid gravity stress tensor to first order in derivatives, but
deviates from the later at second order and finite D.

the principle of the cellular automaton and the Kalman filter. It has been
accelerated by the usage of graphics cards (GPUs). A pipelined processing
allows to perform the tracking on the GPU, the data transfer, and the
preprocessing on the CPU in parallel. In order for CPU pre- and postprocessing
to keep step with the GPU the pipeline uses multiple threads. A splitting of
the tracking in multiple phases searching for short local track segments first
improves data locality and makes the algorithm suited to run on a GPU. Due to
special optimizations this course of action is not second to a global approach.
Because of non-associative floating-point arithmetic a binary comparison of GPU

the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, which is today the most powerful
particle accelerator worldwide. The High Level Trigger (HLT) is an online
compute farm of about 200 nodes, which reconstructs events measured by the
ALICE detector in real-time. The HLT uses a custom online data-transport
framework to distribute data and workload among the compute nodes. ALICE
employs several calibration-sensitive subdetectors, e.g. the TPC (Time
Projection Chamber). For a precise reconstruction, the HLT has to perform the
calibration online. Online-calibration can make certain Offline calibration
steps obsolete and can thus speed up Offline analysis. Looking forward to ALICE
Run III starting in 2020, online calibration becomes a necessity. The main
detector used for track reconstruction is the TPC. Reconstructing the
trajectories in the TPC is the most compute-intense step during event
reconstruction. Therefore, a fast tracking implementation is of great
importance. Reconstructed TPC tracks build the basis for the calibration making
a fast online-tracking mandatory. We present several components developed for
the ALICE High Level Trigger to perform fast event reconstruction and to
provide features required for online calibration. As first topic, we present
our TPC tracker, which employs GPUs to speed up the processing, and which bases
on a Cellular Automaton and on the Kalman filter. Our TPC tracking algorithm
has been successfully used in 2011 and 2012 in the lead-lead and the
proton-lead runs. We have improved it to leverage features of newer GPUs and we
have ported it to support OpenCL, CUDA, and CPUs with a single common source
code. This makes us vendor independent. As second topic, we present framework
extensions required for online calibration. ...

canonical simulation because they require estimating the grand-canonical radial
distribution. The same essential difficulty is encountered when attempting to
estimate the direct correlation function of Ornstein-Zernike theory by
inverting the pair correlation functions. We present a new theory that applies
to the entire, finite, simulation volume, so that no cutoff issues arise at
all. The theory gives the direct correlation function for closed systems, while
smoothness of the direct correlation function in reciprocal space allows
calculating canonical KB integrals via a well-posed extrapolation to the
origin. The present analysis method represents an improvement over previous
work because it makes use of the entire simulation volume and its convergence
can be accelerated using known properties of the direct correlation function.
Using known interaction energy functions can make this extrapolation near
perfect accuracy in the low-density case. Because finite size effects are
stronger in the canonical than the grand-canonical ensemble, we state ensemble
correction formulas for the chemical potential and the KB coefficients. The new
theory is illustrated with both analytical and simulation results on the 1D
Ising model and a supercritical Lennard-Jones fluid. For the latter, the
finite-size corrections are shown to be small.

energies, specifically useful for describing the long-range nature of ions in
an electrolyte solution. The theory avoids common issues with field theories by
writing the excess chemical potential directly as a maximum-entropy variational
problem in the space of solvent 1-particle density functions. The theory was
developed to provide a simple physical picture of the relationship between the
solution's spatial dielectric function, ion screening, and the chemical
potential. The key idea is to view the direct correlation function of molecular
Ornstein-Zernike theory as a Green's function for both longitudinal and
transverse electrostatic dipole relaxation of the solvent. Molecular simulation
data is used to calculate these direct correlation functions, and suggests that
the most important solvation effects can be captured with only a screened
random phase approximation. Using that approximation predicts both the Born
solvation free energy and a Debye-Huckel law in close agreement with the mean

with different approaches to clean it. A large class of data repair algorithms
rely on data-quality rules and integrity constraints to detect and repair the
data. A well-studied class of integrity constraints is Functional Dependencies
(FDs, for short) that specify dependencies among attributes in a relation. In
this paper, we address three major challenges in data repairing: (1) Accuracy:
Most existing techniques strive to produce repairs that minimize changes to the
data. However, this process may produce incorrect combinations of attribute
values (or patterns). In this work, we formalize the interaction of FD-induced
patterns and select repairs that result in preserving frequent patterns found
in the original data. This has the potential to yield a better repair quality
both in terms of precision and recall. (2) Interpretability of repairs: Current
data repair algorithms produce repairs in the form of data updates that are not
necessarily understandable. This makes it hard to debug repair decisions and
trace the chain of steps that produced them. To this end, we define a new
formalism to declaratively express repairs that are easy for users to reason
about. (3) Scalability: We propose a linear-time algorithm to compute repairs
that outperforms state-of-the-art FD repairing algorithms by orders of
magnitude in repair time. Our experiments using both real-world and synthetic
data demonstrate that our new repair approach consistently outperforms existing
techniques both in terms of repair quality and scalability.

used methods to obtain the subtypes, but without the guidance of the genetic
information, all these methods may lead to subtypes of little utility in
genetic analysis. Recently, some multi-view co-clustering methods are proposed
to ameliorate this drawback. However, these new methods did not take the
missing values inside the data into consideration. To get around this
limitation, we extended one of the multi-view methods to dealing with the
missing values and clustering simultaneously. We applied this method to 2230
European-American sample and found that the well-known generic variant
rs1229984 (in the ADH1B candidate gene) for the subtype is more significant
than that corresponding to case-control association test. Finally, we verify it
on the 1707 replication sample and find it significant, too.

the system to minimize the loss of power load and natural gas load in

simulate physics and address a host of problems on collective dynamics arising

sphere to investigate the curvature driven dynamic structures and analyze the
statistical behaviors in equilibrium. Under the simple propagation and
collision rules, we show that the uniform collective movement of the particles
on the sphere is geometrically frustrated, leading to several non-equilibrium
dynamic structures not found in the planar lattice, such as the emergent bubble
and vortex structures. With the accumulation of the collision effect, the
system ultimately reaches equilibrium in the sense that the distribution of the
coarse-grained speed approaches the two-dimensional Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution despite the population fluctuations in the coarse-grained cells.
The emergent regularity in the statistical behavior of the system is
rationalized by mapping our system to a generalized random walk model. This
work demonstrates the capability of the spherical lattice gas automaton in
revealing the lattice-guided dynamic structures and simulating the equilibrium
physics. It suggests the promising possibility of using lattice gas automata
defined on various curved surfaces to explore geometrically driven
non-equilibrium physics.

widely used to quantitatively characterize the performance of biological
sensing and information transduction. However, once coupled with selection in
response to decision-making, the sensing signal could have more or less
evolutionary value than its mutual or directed information. In this work, we
show that an individually sensed signal always has a better fitness value, on
average, than its mutual or directed information. The fitness gain, which
satisfies fluctuation relations (FRs), is attributed to the selection of
organisms in a population that obtain a better sensing signal by chance. A new
quantity, similar to the coarse-grained entropy production in information
thermodynamics, is introduced to quantify the total fitness gain from
individual sensing, which also satisfies FRs. Using this quantity, the
optimizing fitness gain from individual sensing is shown to be related to
fidelity allocations for individual environmental histories. Our results are
supplemented by numerical verifications of FRs, and a discussion on how this

the downlink coverage probability of a Poisson network with double shadowed

{\kappa}-{\mu} shadowed fading with integer fading parameters. The closest base
station association rule without shadowing is considered. For analytical

As a main theoretical result, a closed-form expression for the downlink

desired signal and arbitrary fading for the interfering signals is successfully
derived. Numerical simulations reveal that the double shadowed fading provides
a pessimistic coverage on a Poisson network compared with the long-term

show its utility in applications in which the underlying design matrix is a
Kronecker product of smaller matrices. This allows us to solve Kronecker
product regression and non-negative Kronecker product regression, as well as
regularized spline regression. Our main technical result is then in extending
TensorSketch to other norms. That is, TensorSketch only provides input sparsity

effective Bianchi-IX spacetime in two different quantizations - the connection
operator based `A' quantization and the extrinsic curvature based `K'
quantization. We show that in the effective spacetime description with
arbitrary matter content, it is necessary to include inverse triad corrections
to resolve all the strong singularities in the `A' quantization. Whereas in the
`K' quantization these results can be obtained without including inverse triad
corrections. Under these conditions, the energy density, expansion and shear
scalars for both of the quantization prescriptions are bounded. Notably, both
the quantizations can result in potentially curvature divergent events if
matter content allows divergences in the partial derivatives of the energy
density with respect to the triad variables at a finite energy density. Such
events are found to be weak curvature singularities beyond which geodesics can
be extended in the effective spacetime. Our results show that all potential
strong curvature singularities of the classical theory are forbidden in
Bianchi-IX spacetime in loop quantum cosmology and geodesic evolution never
breaks down for such events.

cluster counts as a function of redshift and mass can constrain the parameters
of our Universe. They are also useful to understand the formation and evolution
of clusters. We develop an improved version of the AMACFI cluster finder (now
AMASCFI) and apply it to the 154 deg2 of the Canada France Hawaii Telescope
Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) to obtain a catalogue of 1371 cluster candidates with
mass M200 > 10^14 Msun and redshift z < 0.7. We derive the selection function
of AMASCFI from the Millennium simulation, and cluster masses from a
richness-mass scaling relation built from matching our candidates with X-ray
detections. We study the evolution of these clusters with mass and redshift by
computing the i'-band galaxy luminosity functions (GLFs) for the early (ETGs)
and late-type galaxies (LTGs). This sample is 90% pure and 70% complete,
therefore our results are representative the cluster population in these
redshift and mass ranges. We find an increase of both the ETG and LTG faint
populations with decreasing redshift (with Schechter slopes alpha_ETG = -0.65
+/- 0.03 at z=0.6 and alpha_ETG = -0.79 +\- 0.02 at z=0.2) and also a decrease
of the LTG bright end, but not of the ETG's. Our large sample allows us to
break the degeneracy between mass and redshift, finding that the redshift
evolution is more pronounced in high-mass clusters, but that there is no
significant dependence of the faint end on mass for a given redshift. These
results show that the cluster red sequence is mainly formed at redshift z >
0.7, and that faint ETGs continue to enrich the red sequence through quenching
of brighter LTGs at z < 0.7. The efficiency of this quenching is higher in
large-mass clusters while the accretion rate of faint LTGs is lower as the more
massive clusters have already emptied most of their environment at higher
redshifts.

learning deep networks under label noise focus on modifying the network
architecture and on algorithms for estimating true labels from noisy labels. An
alternate approach would be to look for loss functions that are inherently
noise-tolerant. For binary classification there exist theoretical results on
loss functions that are robust to label noise. In this paper, we provide some
sufficient conditions on a loss function so that risk minimization under that
loss function would be inherently tolerant to label noise for multiclass
classification problems. These results generalize the existing results on
noise-tolerant loss functions for binary classification. We study some of the
widely used loss functions in deep networks and show that the loss function
based on mean absolute value of error is inherently robust to label noise. Thus
standard back propagation is enough to learn the true classifier even under
label noise. Through experiments, we illustrate the robustness of risk
minimization with such loss functions for learning neural networks.

estimating large precision matrices. In particular, there are scientific
applications such as longitudinal data, meteorology and spectroscopy in which
the ordering of the variables can be interpreted through a bandable structure
on the Cholesky factor of the precision matrix. However, the minimax theory has
still been largely unknown, as opposed to the well established minimax results
over the corresponding bandable covariance matrices. In this paper, we focus on
two commonly used types of parameter spaces, and develop the optimal rates of
convergence under both the operator norm and the Frobenius norm. A striking
phenomenon is found: two types of parameter spaces are fundamentally different
under the operator norm but enjoy the same rate optimality under the Frobenius
norm, which is in sharp contrast to the equivalence of corresponding two types
of bandable covariance matrices under both norms. This fundamental difference
is established by carefully constructing the corresponding minimax lower
bounds. Two new estimation procedures are developed: for the operator norm, our
optimal procedure is based on a novel local cropping estimator targeting on all
principle submatrices of the precision matrix while for the Frobenius norm, our
optimal procedure relies on a delicate regression-based thresholding rule.
Lepski's method is considered to achieve optimal adaptation. We further
establish rate optimality in the nonparanormal model. Numerical studies are
carried out to confirm our theoretical findings.

of the decay rate on the temperature and the barrier strength. However, the
origin of the decay observed in the experiment remains unclear. We calculate
the rate of supercurrent decay due to thermally activated phase slips (TAPS) by
using the Kramers formula based on the Gross-Pitaevskii mean-field theory. The
resulting decay rate is astronomically small compared to that measured in the
experiment, thus excluding the possibility of TAPS as the decay mechanism.
Alternatively, we argue that three-body losses can be relevant to the observed
decay and predict that one can observe supercurrent decay via TAPS by
decreasing the number of atoms.

used to significantly speed up numerous applications. One of the areas in which
GPUs have recently led to a significant speed-up is model checking. In model
checking, state spaces, i.e., large directed graphs, are explored to verify
whether models satisfy desirable properties. GPUexplore is a GPU-based model
checker that uses a hash table to efficiently keep track of already explored
states. As a large number of states is discovered and stored during such an
exploration, the hash table should be able to quickly handle many inserts and
queries concurrently. In this paper, we experimentally compare two different
hash tables optimised for the GPU, one being the GPUexplore hash table, and the
other using Cuckoo hashing. We compare the performance of both hash tables
using random and non-random data obtained from model checking experiments, to
analyse the applicability of the two hash tables for state space exploration.
We conclude that Cuckoo hashing is three times faster than GPUexplore hashing
for random data, and that Cuckoo hashing is five to nine times faster for
non-random data. This suggests great potential to further speed up GPUexplore
in the near future.

synaptic connections that are both reconfigurable and stable. Here, we report
realization of stable atomic-switch networks (ASN), with inherent complex

device conductance reflects the configuration of synapses which can be
modulated via voltage stimulus. By controlling Relative Humidity (RH) and
oxygen partial-pressure during NP deposition we obtain stochastic conductance
switching that is stable over several months. Detailed characterization reveals
signatures of electric-field induced atomic-wire formation within the

rates, which can be utilized as short-term to long-term memory conversion. This
demonstration of stable stochastic switching in ASNs provides a promising route
to hardware implementation of biological neuronal models and, as an example, we
highlight possible applications in Reservoir Computing (RC).

it is known that this is the best possible complexity in the function-gradient

The method of linear conjugate gradients (CG) also satisfies the same
complexity bound in the special case of strongly convex quadratic functions,
but in this special case it can be faster than the AG and GD methods.
  Despite similarities in the algorithms and their asymptotic convergence
rates, the conventional analysis of the running time of CG is mostly disjoint
from that of AG and GD. The analyses of the AG and GD methods are also rather
distinct.
  Our main result is analyses of the three methods that share several common
threads: all three analyses show a relationship to a certain ""idealized

Bubeck-Lee-Singh geometric lemma, and all three have the same potential that is
computable at run-time and exhibits decrease by a factor of $1-\sqrt{\ell/L}$
or better per iteration.
  One application of these analyses is that they open the possibility of hybrid

to perform well in computational tests.

ordering on the dynamics of thermomolecular pressure gradient driven premelted
films bound by an elastic membrane. The confinement induced ordering is modeled
using a film thickness dependent viscosity. When there is no confinement
induced ordering, we recover the similarity solution for the evolution of the
elastic membrane, which exhibits an infinite sequence of oscillations. However,
when the confinement induced viscosity is comparable to the bulk viscosity, the
numerical solutions of the full system reveal the conditions under which the
oscillations and similarity solutions vanish. Implications of our results for
general thermomechanical dynamics, frost heave observations and cryogenic cell
preservation are discussed. Finally, through its influence on the viscosity,
the confinement effect implicitly introduces a new universal length scale into
the volume flux. Thus, there are a host of thin film problems, from droplet
breakup to wetting/dewetting dynamics, whose properties (similarity solutions,
regularization, and compact support) will change under the action of the
confinement effect. Therefore, our study suggests revisiting the mathematical
structure and experimental implications of a wide range of problems within the
framework of the confinement effect.

a finite bandgap in the spectrum of the spin-orbit-coupled binary Bose-Einstein
condensate with the Zeeman splitting, in the two-dimensional free space, under
conditions which make the kinetic-energy terms in the respective coupled
Gross-Pitaevskii equations negligible. Unlike a recent work which used
long-range dipole-dipole interactions to construct stable gap solitons in a
similar setting, we here demonstrate that stable solitons are supported by
generic local interactions of both attractive and repulsive signs, provided
that the relative strength of the cross/self interaction in the two-component
system does not exceed a critical value ~ 0.77. A boundary between stable and
unstable fundamental 2D gap solitons is precisely predicted by the
Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion, while all excited states of the 2D solitons, with
vorticities (m, 1 + m) in the two components, m = 1, 2, ..., are unstable. The
analysis of the one-dimensional (1D) reduction of the system produces an exact
analytical solution for the family of gap solitons which populate the entire
bandgap, the family being fully stable. Motion of the 1D solitons in the
trapping potential is considered too, showing that their effective mass is
positive or negative if the cubic nonlinearity is attractive or repulsive,
respectively.

increase in the popularity of wearable health devices provides a significant
new data source, making it possible to track the user's lifestyle real-time
through web interfaces, both to consumer as well as their healthcare provider,
potentially. However, at present there is a gap between lifestyle data (e.g.,
sleep, physical activity) and clinical outcomes normally captured in EHRs. This
is a critical barrier for the use of this new source of signal for healthcare
decision making. Applying deep learning to wearables data provides a new
opportunity to overcome this barrier.
  To address the problem of the unavailability of clinical data from a major
fraction of subjects and unrepresentative subject populations, we propose a
novel unsupervised (task-agnostic) time-series representation learning
technique called act2vec. act2vec learns useful features by taking into account
the co-occurrence of activity levels along with periodicity of human activity
patterns. The learned representations are then exploited to boost the
performance of disorder-specific supervised learning models. Furthermore, since
many disorders are often related to each other, a phenomenon referred to as
co-morbidity, we use a multi-task learning framework for exploiting the shared
structure of disorder inducing life-style choices partially captured in the
wearables data. Empirical evaluation using actigraphy data from 4,124 subjects

However, their performance is evaluated on other metrics designed to better
correlate with human assessments. Recently, it has been shown that
reinforcement learning (RL) can directly optimize these metrics in tasks such
as captioning. However, this is computationally costly and requires specifying
a baseline reward at each step to make training converge. We propose a fast
approach to optimize one's objective of interest through the REINFORCE
algorithm. First we show that, by replacing model samples with ground-truth
sentences, RL training can be seen as a form of weighted cross-entropy loss,
giving a fast, RL-based pre-training algorithm. Second, we propose to use the
consensus among ground-truth captions of the same video as the baseline reward.
This can be computed very efficiently. We call the complete proposal
Consensus-based Sequence Training (CST). Applied to the MSRVTT video captioning
benchmark, our proposals train significantly faster than comparable methods and
establish a new state-of-the-art on the task, improving the CIDEr score from
47.3 to 54.2.

ambient conditions. Moreover, at high temperatures it undergoes a structural
phase transition into a less symmetric trigonal configuration. It has long been
suspected that the strong spin-orbit coupling in Polonium is involved in both
peculiarities, but the precise mechanism by which it operates remains
controversial. Here, we introduce a single microscopic model capable of
capturing the atomic structure of all chalcogen crystals: Selenium, Tellurium,
and Polonium. We show that the strong spin-orbit coupling in Polonium
suppresses the trigonal charge and orbital ordered state known to be the ground
state configuration of Selenium and Tellurium, and allows the simple cubic
state to prevail instead. We also confirm a recent suggestion based on ab
initio calculations that a small increase in the lattice constant may
effectively decrease the role of spin-orbit coupling, leading to a re-emergence
of the trigonal orbital ordered state at high temperatures. We conclude that
Polonium is a unique element, in which spins, orbitals, electronic charges, and
lattice deformations all cooperate and collectively cause the emergence of the
only elemental crystal structure with the simplest possible, cubic, lattice.

the lapse function is constrained to be equal to a function of the determinant
of the spatial metric $f(h)$, as a potential origin of a dark fluid with a
generally $h$-dependent equation of state parameter. We establish the
Hamiltonian analysis and the canonical path integral for the theory. All the
special cases that do not match unimodular gravity involve violation of general
covariance, and consequently the physical content of the theory is changed
significantly. Particularly, the case of a constant function $f$ is shown to
contain an extra physical degree of freedom in each point of space. Physical
consequences of the extra degree of freedom are studied in a linearized theory,
where the extra mode is carried by the trace of the metric perturbation. The
trace mode does not propagate as a wave, since it satisfies an elliptic partial
differential equation in spacetime. Consequently, the trace perturbation is
shown to grow exponentially with time, which implies instability. The case of a
general $f(h)$ involves additional second-class constraints, which implies the
presence of an extra global degree of freedom that depends only on time
(instead of the extra local degree of freedom in the case of a constant $f$).

accreting compact objects, where massive outflows are inevitable. Using the
long-term monitoring data with the Swift X-ray Telescope, we identified a
common feature in bright, hard ULXs: they display a quasi-periodic modulation
in their hard X-ray band but not in their soft band. As a result, some sources
show a bimodal distribution on the hardness intensity map. We argue that these
model-independent results can be well interpreted in a picture that involves
supercritical accretion with precession, where the hard X-ray emission from the
central funnel is more or less beamed, while the soft X-rays may arise from the
photosphere of the massive outflow and be nearly isotropic. It implies that
precession may be ubiquitous in supercritical systems, such as the Galactic
microquasar SS~433. How the hard X-rays are modulated can be used to constrain
the angular distribution of the hard X-ray emission and the geometry of the
accretion flow. We also find that two ULX pulsars (NGC 5907 ULX-1 and NGC 7793
P13) show similar behaviors but no bimodal distribution, which may imply that
they have a different beaming shape or mechanism.

sequences and pIs using a recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term
memory (LSTM) cells. The trained model obtains an RMSE and R$^2$ of 0.28 and
0.95 for the external test set. The model is not based on pKa values, but
prediction of constructed test sequences show similar rankings as already known
pKa values. The prediction depends mostly on the existence of known acidic and
basic amino acids with fine-adjusted based on the neighboring sequence and
position of the charged amino acids in the peptide chain.

long standing problems in physics such as dark matter and dark energy. The
pseudo-scalar axion whose derivative corresponds to the Hodge dual of the
Kalb-Ramond field strength in four dimensions plays crucial roles in explaining
several astrophysical and cosmological observations. Therefore, the detection
of axionic hairs/Kalb-Ramond field which appears as closed string excitations
in the heterotic string spectrum may provide a profound insight to our
understanding of the current universe. The current level of precision achieved
in solar-system based tests employed to test general relativity, is not
sufficient to detect the presence of axion. However, the near horizon regime of
quasars where the curvature effects are maximum seems to be a natural
laboratory to probe such additions to the matter sector. The continuum spectrum
emitted from the accretion disk around quasars encapsulates the imprints of the
background spacetime and hence acts as a storehouse of information regarding
the nature of gravitational interaction in extreme situations. The surfeit of
data available in the electromagnetic domain provides a further motivation to
explore such systems. Using the optical data for eighty Palomar Green quasars
we demonstrate that the theoretical estimates of optical luminosity explain the
observations best when the axionic field is assumed to be absent. However,
axion which violates the energy condition seems to be favored by observations
which has several interesting consequences. Error estimators, including reduced
$\chi^{2}$, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, index of agreement and modified versions
of the last two are used to solidify our conclusion and the implications of our
result are discussed.

the LMC composite star field, because there is a remarkable enhancement of

the existence of the LMC cluster age gap; the assumption of a cluster formation
rate similar to that of the LMC star field does not help to conciliate so large

The lack of further analyses to confirm the physical reality as genuine star

of lifting such structures to their Lie algebroid version makes them less

which encodes the singularities, and show when structures exhibiting such
singularities can be lifted to a Lie algebroid built out of the divisor. Once
one has successfully lifted the structure, it becomes possible to study it
using more powerful techniques. In the case of Poisson structures one can turn
to employing symplectic techniques. These lead for example to normal form
results for the underlying Poisson structures around their singular loci. In
this thesis we further adapt the methods of Gompf and Thurston for constructing
symplectic structures out of fibration-like maps to their Lie algebroid

Lefschetz fibration and show when these give rise to A-symplectic structures

estimating first the posterior distribution of the auxiliary variables that
assign each observation to a group in the mixture. The posterior distributions
of the remainder of the parameters in the mixture is obtained by averaging over
their conditional posterior marginals on the auxiliary variables using Bayesian
model averaging.
  A new algorithm based on Gibbs sampling is used to approximate the posterior
distribution of the auxiliary variables without sampling any other parameter in
the model. In particular, the modes of the full conditionals of the parameters
of the densities in the mixture are computed and these are plugged-in to the
full conditional of the auxiliary variables to draw samples. This
approximation, that we have called 'modal' Gibbs sampling, reduces the
computational burden in the Gibbs sampling algorithm and still provides very
good estimates of the posterior distribution of the auxiliary variables.
Conditional models on the auxiliary variables are fitted using the Integrated
Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) to obtain the conditional posterior
distributions, including modes, of the distributional parameters in the
mixtures.
  This approach is general enough to consider mixture models with discrete or
continuous outcomes from a wide range of distributions and latent models as
conditional model fitting is done with INLA. This presents several other
advantages, such as fast fitting of the conditional models, not being
restricted to the use of conjugate priors on the model parameters and being
less prone to label switching. Within this framework, computing the marginal
likelihood of the mixture model when the number of groups in the mixture is
known is easy and it can be used to tackle selection of the number of

been considered by using a hydrodynamic model. It is found that FRET rate and
efficiency can be enhanced simultaneously by more than 9 and 3 orders of
magnitude, respectively. The physical origins for these phenomena have been
disclosed. Two opposite phenomena, the energy transfer rate is independent or
dependent of the local density of optical states (LDOS), have been observed in
the same system under different conditions. These findings not only help us to
understand the unresolved debate on how the FRET rate depends on the LDOS, but
also provide a new way to realize ultrafast energy transfer process with
ultrahigh efficiency.

depend on a notion of guardedness, which guarantees unique solvability of
recursive equations and requires roughly that recursive calls happen only under
certain guarding operations. On the other hand, many models of iteration do
admit unguarded iteration. Solutions are then no longer unique, and in general
not even determined as least or greatest fixpoints, being instead governed by
quasi-equational axioms. Monads that support unguarded iteration in this sense
are called (complete) Elgot monads. Here, we propose to equip (Kleisli
categories of) monads with an abstract notion of guardedness and then require
solvability of abstractly guarded recursive equations; examples of such
abstractly guarded pre-iterative monads include both iterative monads and Elgot
monads, the latter by deeming any recursive definition to be abstractly
guarded. Our main result is then that Elgot monads are precisely the
iteration-congruent retracts of abstractly guarded iterative monads, the latter
being defined as admitting unique solutions of abstractly guarded recursive
equations; in other words, models of unguarded iteration come about by
quotienting models of guarded iteration.

the Galactic chemistry but also because they are useful to estimate physical
parameters in a large variety of interstellar medium environments. The CO is
one of the most important molecules to trace the molecular gas in the
interstellar medium, and the 13CO/C18O abundance ratio is usually used to
estimate molecular masses and densities of regions with moderate to high
densities. Nowadays this kind of isotopes ratios are in general indirectly
derived from elemental abundances ratios. We present the first 13CO/C18O
abundance ratio study performed from CO isotopes observations towards a large
sample of Galactic sources of different nature at different locations. To study
the 13CO/C18O abundance ratio it was used 12CO J=3-2 data obtained form the CO
High-Resolution Survey, 13CO and C18O J=3-2 data from the 13CO/C18O (J=3-2)
Heterodyne Inner Milky Way Plane Survey, and some complementary data extracted
from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope database. It was analyzed a sample of
198 sources composed by young stellar objects (YSOs), HII and diffuse HII
regions as catalogued in the Red MSX Source Survey in 27.5 < l < 46.5 and |b| <
0.5. Most of the analyzed sources are located in the galactocentric distance
range 4.0-6.5 kpc. We found that YSOs have, in average, smaller 13CO/C18O
abundance ratios than HII and diffuse HII regions. Taking into account that the
gas associated with YSOs should be less affected by the radiation than in the
case of the others sources, selective far-UV photodissociation of C18O is
confirmed. The 13CO/C18O abundance ratios obtained in this work are
systematically lower than the predicted from the known elemental abundance
relations. These results would be useful in future studies of molecular gas
related to YSOs and HII regions based on the observation of these isotopes.

prismatic tensegrity building blocks which have excellent strength-to-weight

with coupled axial-torsional stiffness matrix is first developed to study the
band structures of the proposed lightweight metastructures. Unit cell designs
based on both Bragg scattering and local resonance mechanism are investigated
to generate bandgaps at desired frequency ranges. Broadband full-wave
attenuation is found in the tensegrity metastructure with special
opposite-chirality unit cells. Furthermore, tunable stiffness in the prismatic
tensegrity structure is investigated and 'small-on-large' tunability in the
tensegrity metastructure is achieved by harnessing the geometrically nonlinear
deformation through an external control torque. Prestress adjustment for fine
tuning of the band structure is also investigated. Finally, frequency response
tests on finite metastructures are preformed to validate their wave attenuation
ability as well as their wave propagation tunability. The proposed tensegrity
metastructures could be very useful in various engineering applications where
lightweight and tunable structures with broadband vibration suspension and wave
attenuation ability are in high demand.

in an opposite polarity dusty plasma system, containing inertial warm
negatively and positively charged dust particles as well as non-extensive
q-distributed elec- trons and ions, has been theoretically investigated. The
nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation is derived by employing the reductive
perturbation method. The NLS equation leads to the MI of DAWs as well as to the
formation of DAW rogue waves (DARWs), which are formed due to the effects of
nonlinearity in the propagation of DAWs. Both stable and unstable regions are
revealed from the analysis of the NLS equation. It is observed that the basic
features of the DAWs (viz. stability of the wave profile, MI growth rate,
amplitude, and width of DARWs) are significantly modified by the various plasma
parameters such as non-extensive parameter, electron number density, and
electron temperature. The existence of the non-extensive electron/ion
distribution creates an influence on the MI of the waves. It is observed that
non-extensive distributed ions have more effect on the MI of the DAWs than
electrons.

between oscillators, we herein investigate the relation between the temporal
precision and the information flow between oscillators in the linearized
Kuramoto model by using stochastic thermodynamics. For general coupling, we
find that the temporal precision is bounded from below by the information flow.
We generalize the model to incorporate a time-delayed coupling and demonstrate
that the same relation also holds for the time-delayed case. Furthermore, the
temporal precision is demonstrated to be improved in the presence of the time
delay, and we show that the increased information flow is responsible for the
time-delay-induced precision improvement.

the first results for the measurement of total electron plus positron fluxes
between 25 GeV and 4.6 TeV. A spectral break at about 0.9 TeV and a tentative
peak excess around 1.4 TeV have been found. However, it is very difficult to
reproduce both the peak signal and the smooth background including spectral
break simultaneously. We point out that the numbers of events in the two energy
ranges (bins) close to the 1.4 TeV excess have $1\sigma$ deficits. With the
basic physics principles such as simplicity and naturalness, we consider the
$-2\sigma$, $+2\sigma$, and $-1\sigma$ deviations due to statistical
fluctuations for the 1229.3~GeV bin, 1411.4~GeV bin, and 1620.5~GeV bin.
Interestingly, we show that all the DAMPE data can be explained consistently
via both the continuous distributed pulsar and dark matter interpretations,
which have $\chi^{2} \simeq 17.2 $ and $\chi^{2} \simeq 13.9$ (for all the 38
points in DAMPE electron/positron spectrum with 3 of them revised),
respectively. These results are different from the previous analyses by
neglecting the 1.4 TeV excess. At the same time, we do a similar global fitting
on the newly released CALET lepton data, which could also be interpreted by
such configurations. Moreover, we present a $U(1)_D$ dark matter model with
Breit-Wigner mechanism, which can provide the proper dark matter annihilation
cross section and escape the CMB constraint. Furthermore, we suggest a few ways
to test our proposal.

potential redshift evolution of both the slope and scatter of the
mass-observable scaling relations used in cosmology studies based on cluster

(tSZ) mapping of a cluster from the sample of the NIKA2 SZ large program that
aims at constraining the redshift evolution of cluster pressure profiles and
the tSZ-mass scaling relation. We have observed the galaxy cluster PSZ2
G144.83+25.11 at redshift $z=0.58$ with the NIKA2 camera, a dual-band (150 and
260 GHz) instrument operated at the IRAM 30-meter telescope. We identify a
thermal pressure excess in the south-west region of PSZ2 G144.83+25.11 and a
high redshift sub-millimeter point source that affect the intracluster medium
(ICM) morphology of the cluster. The NIKA2 data are used jointly with tSZ data
acquired by the MUSTANG, Bolocam and $Planck$ experiments in order to
non-parametrically set the best constraints on the electronic pressure
distribution from the cluster core ($\rm{R} \sim 0.02 \rm{R_{500}}$) to its
outskirts ($\rm{R} \sim 3 \rm{R_{500}} $). We investigate the impact of the
over-pressure region on the shape of the pressure profile and on the
constraints on the integrated Compton parameter $\rm{Y_{500}}$. A hydrostatic
mass analysis is also performed by combining the tSZ-constrained pressure
profile with the deprojected electronic density profile from XMM-$Newton$. This
allows us to conclude that the estimates of $\rm{Y_{500}}$ and $\rm{M_{500}}$
obtained from the analysis with and without masking the disturbed ICM region
differ by 65 and 79% respectively. (abridged)

system using technical analysis indicators is presented. The model developed
first converts the financial time series data into a series of buy-sell-hold
trigger signals using the most commonly preferred technical analysis
indicators. Then, a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network (ANN)
model is trained in the learning stage on the daily stock prices between 1997
and 2007 for all of the Dow30 stocks. Apache Spark big data framework is used
in the training stage. The trained model is then tested with data from 2007 to
2017. The results indicate that by choosing the most appropriate technical
indicators, the neural network model can achieve comparable results against the
Buy and Hold strategy in most of the cases. Furthermore, fine tuning the
technical indicators and/or optimization strategy can enhance the overall
trading performance.

Parameterized-Background Data-Weak (PBDW) formulation, a real-time and in-situ

Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), proposed in [Y Maday, AT Patera, JD
Penn, M Yano, Int J Numer Meth Eng, 102(5), 933-965]. Given $M$ noisy
measurements of the state, PBDW seeks an approximation of the form $u^{\star} =
z^{\star} + \eta^{\star}$, where the \emph{background} $z^{\star}$ belongs to a
$N$-dimensional \emph{background space} informed by a parameterized
mathematical model, and the \emph{update} $\eta^{\star}$ belongs to a
$M$-dimensional \emph{update space} informed by the experimental observations.
The contributions of the present work are threefold: first, we extend the
adaptive formulation proposed in [T Taddei, M2AN, 51(5), 1827-1858] to general
linear observation functionals, to effectively deal with noisy observations;
second, we consider an user-defined choice of the update space, to improve
convergence with respect to the number of measurements; third, we propose an
\emph{a priori} error analysis for general linear functionals in the presence
of noise, to identify the different sources of state estimation error and
ultimately motivate the adaptive procedure. We present results for two
synthetic model problems in Acoustics, to illustrate the elements of the
methodology and to prove its effectiveness. We further present results for a
synthetic problem in Fluid Mechanics to demonstrate the applicability of the
approach to vector-valued fields.

in a 3-Higgs Doublet Model (3HDM) where only one doublet acquires a Vacuum
Expectation Value (VEV), preserving a parity $Z_2$. The other two doublets are
\textit{inert} and do not develop a VEV, leading to a {\it dark scalar sector}
controlled by $Z_2$, with the lightest CP-even dark scalar $H_1$ being the DM
candidate. This leads to the loop induced decay of the next-to-lightest scalar,
$H_2 \to H_1 f \bar f$ ($f=u,d,c,s,b,e,\mu,\tau$), mediated by both dark CP-odd
and charged scalars. This is a smoking-gun signal of the 3HDM since it is not
allowed in the 2HDM with one inert doublet and is expected to be important when
$H_2$ and $H_1$ are close in mass. In practice, this signature can be observed
in the cascade decay of the SM-like Higgs boson, $h\to H_1 H_2\to H_1 H_1 f
\bar f$ into two DM particles and di-leptons/di-jets, where $h$ is produced
from either gluon-gluon Fusion (ggF) or Vector Boson Fusion (VBF). However,
this signal competes with the tree-level channel $q\bar q\to H_1H_1Z^*\to
H_1H_1f \bar f$. We devise some benchmarks, compliant with collider, DM and
cosmological data, for which the interplay between these modes is discussed. In
particular, we show that the resulting detector signature, $\Et\; f \bar f$,
with invariant mass of $ f \bar f$ much smaller than $m_Z$, can potentially be
extracted already during Run 2 and 3. For example, the $H_2\to H_1\gamma^*$ and
$\gamma^*\to e^+e^-$ case will give a spectacular QED mono-shower signal.

instabilities is calculated for a Harris equilibrium. In contrast to the
conventional 2D geometry, which considers only modes at the center of the
current sheet, modes can span the current sheet in 3D. Modes at each resonant
surface have a unique angle ($\theta$) with respect to the guide field
direction. Both kinetic simulations and numerical eigenmode solutions of the
linearized Vlasov-Maxwell equations have recently revealed that standard
analytic theories vastly overestimate the growth rate of oblique modes ($\theta
\neq 0$). We find that this stabilization is associated with the
density-gradient-driven diamagnetic drift. The analytic theories miss this
drift stabilization because the inner tearing layer broadens at oblique angles
sufficiently far that the assumption of scale separation between the inner and
outer regions of boundary-layer theory breaks down. The dispersion relation
obtained by numerically solving a single second order differential equation is
found to approximately capture the drift stabilization predicted by solutions
of the full integro-differential eigenvalue problem. A simple analytic estimate
for the stability criterion is provided.

tungsten, while its atomistic mechanisms remain little understood. Using
first-principles calculations and statistical models, we studied the
self-clustering behavior of hydrogen in tungsten. Unlike previous speculations
that hydrogen self-clusters are energetically unstable owing to the general
repulsion between two hydrogens, we demonstrated that hydrogen self-cluster
becomes more favorable as the cluster size increases. We found that hydrogen
atoms would form two-dimensional platelet-like structures along {100} planes.
These hydrogen self-clustering behaviors can be quantitative understood by the
competition between long-ranged elastic attraction and local electronic
repulsion. Further statistical analysis showed that there exists a critical
hydrogen concentration above which hydrogen self-clusters are thermodynamically
stable and kinetically feasible. Based on this critical hydrogen concentration,
the plasma loading conditions under which hydrogen self-clusters form were
predicted. Our predictions showed excellent agreement with experimental results
of hydrogen bubble formation in tungsten exposed to low-energy hydrogen
irradiation. Finally, we proposed a possible mechanism for the hydrogen bubble
nucleation via hydrogen self-clustering. This work provides mechanistic
insights and quantitative models towards understanding of plasma-induced
hydrogen bubble formation in plasma-facing tungsten.

long debate whether Turing Machines can simulate the consciousness mind
behaviors in the materialistic universe. Three different hypotheses come out of
such debate, in short:(A) Can; (B) Cannot; (C) Super-Turing machines can.
Because Turing Machines or other kinds of theoretical computing models are
abstract objects while behaviors are real observables, this debate involves at
least three distinct fields of science and technology: physics, computer
engineering, and experimental neuroscience. However, the languages used in
these different fields are highly heterogeneous and not easily interpretable
for each other, making it very difficult to reach partial agreements regarding
this debate, Therefore, the main goal of this manuscript is to establish a
proper language that can translate among those different fields. First, I
propose a theoretical model for analyzing how theoretical computing machines
would physically run in physical time. This model, termed as the xInf, is at
first place Turing-complete in theory, and depending on the properties of
physical time, it can be either Turing-equivalent or Super-Turing in the
physical universe. The xInf Model is demonstrated to be a suitable universal
language to translate among physics, computer engineering, and neuroscience.
Finally, I propose a conjecture that there exists a Minimal Complete Set of
rules in the xInf Model that enables the construction of a physical machine
using inorganic materials that can pass the Turing Test in physical time. I
cannot demonstrate whether such a conjecture to be testified or falsified on
paper using finite-order logic, my only solution is physical time itself, i.e.
an evolutionary competition will eventually tell the conclusion.

a calculation of the frequency and angular dependent response function that a
GW detector would see if massive modes from f(R) theories or scalar tensor
gravity (STG) were present, allowing for sources incident from any direction on
the sky, is shown. In addition, through separate theoretical results which do
not involve the recent GW detections, we show that f(R) theories of gravity
having a third massless mode are ultimately ruled out while there is still room
for STG having a third (massive or massless) mode and for f(R) theories of
gravity having a third massive mode.

DV-curve method for presenting an accurate and simplified output, we propose
HAWPOD, built upon DV- curve method, to analyze genome sequences in five steps:
DNA coding, alignment, noise cancellation, simplification, and modification.
Moreover, all-optical implementation of the HAWPOD method is developed, while
its accuracy is validated through numerical simulations in LUMERICAL FDTD. The
results express the proposed method is much faster than its electrical
counterparts, such as Basic Local Alignment Search Tools.

and perpetual energy supplies to electronics. Traditional WPT technologies face
the challenge of providing Watt-level power over meter-level distance for
Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile devices, such as sensors, controllers,
smart-phones, laptops, etc.. Distributed laser charging (DLC), a new WPT
alternative, has the potential to solve these problems and enable WPT with the
similar experience as WiFi communications. In this paper, we present a
multi-module DLC system model, in order to illustrate its physical fundamentals
and mathematical formula. This analytical modeling enables the evaluation of
power conversion or transmission for each individual module, considering the
impacts of laser wavelength, transmission attenuation and photovoltaic-cell
(PV-cell) temperature. Based on the linear approximation of
electricity-to-laser and laser-to-electricity power conversion validated by
measurement and simulation, we derive the maximum power transmission efficiency
in closed-form. Thus, we demonstrate the variation of the maximum power
transmission efficiency depending on the supply power at the transmitter, laser
wavelength, transmission distance, and PV-cell temperature. Similar to the
maximization of information transmission capacity in wireless information
transfer (WIT), the maximization of the power transmission efficiency is
equally important in WPT. Therefore, this work not only provides the insight of
DLC in theory, but also offers the guideline of DLC system design in practice.

and proposed to be used in calculations of radiation propagation without
scattering in optically thick media; the asymptotic approximation is much
simpler and more precise than the known diffusion approximation. The rigorous
derivation of the diffusion approximation equation and the equation of the
radiation heat conduction approximation is obtained from the constructed
asymptotic solution of the kinetic equation of radiation propagation in
optically thick media. It is shown, that for optically thick media the
asymptotic solution of the kinetic equation of radiation propagation without
scattering is asymptotic expansion of the exact integral solution of that
kinetic equation. Improved boundary conditions, which are essential for
practical application in calculations of radiation propagation, are derived
(for inner boundaries and outer boundaries with vacuum).

positive operators between certain Riesz spaces, which extends the well-known
representation theorem of real-valued MV-algebraic states by positive linear
functionals. When the codomain algebra contains all continuous functions, the
set of all probability maps is convex, and we prove that its extreme points
coincide with homomorphisms. We also show that probability maps can be viewed
as a collection of states indexed by maximal ideals of a codomain algebra and
we characterise this collection in special cases.

whereby a coherent perception emerges from the recruitment of neuronal groups,
and judgment(B),that entails the comparison of two apprehensions acquired at
different times, coded in a suitable language and retrieved by memory. (B)
entails self-consciousness, in so far as the agent who expresses the judgment
must be aware that the two apprehensions are submitted to his/her own scrutiny
and that it is his/her task to extract a mutual relation. Since (B) lasts
around 3 seconds, the semantic value of the pieces under comparison must be
decided within that time. This implies a fast search of the memory contents. As
a fact, exploring human subjects with sequences of simple words, we find
evidence of a limited time window , corresponding to the memory retrieval of a
linguistic item in order to match it with the next one in a text flow (be it
literary, or musical,or figurative). While apprehension is globally explained
as a Bayes inference, judgment tresults from an inverse Bayes inference. As a
consequence, two hermeneutics emerge (called respectively circle and coil). The
first one acts in a pre-assigned space of features. The second one provides the
discovery of novel features, thus unveiling previously unknown aspects and
hence representing the road to reality.
