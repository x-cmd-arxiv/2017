of localization for scattering waves is not simple, because the Rayleigh
scattering is inversely proportional to a high power of wavelength. The
situation is radically different for the out of plane vibrations, so-called
flexural phonons, scattered by pinning centers induced by a substrate. In this
case, the scattering time for vanishing wave vector tends to a finite limit.
One may, therefore, expect that physics of the flexural phonons exhibits
features characteristic for electron localization in two dimensions, albeit
without complications caused by the electron-electron interactions. We confirm
this idea by calculating statistical properties of the Anderson localization of
flexural phonons for a model of elastic sheet in the presence of the pinning
centers. Finally, we discuss possible manifestations of the flexural phonons,
including the localized ones, in the electronic thermal conductance.

The article defines and shows using simulation experiments half-chaotic
networks, which exhibit features much more similar to typically modeled systems
like a living, technological or social than fully random Kauffman networks.
This makes a large change of widely taken view in the dynamics of complex
networks. Current theory predicts that random autonomous systems can be either
ordered or chaotic with fast phase transition between them. However, modeled
adapted systems are not fully random, they are usually stable, but the
estimated parameters are usually ""chaotic"", they place the fully random
networks in the chaotic regime, far from the narrow phase transition. It is
showed that among the not fully random systems with ""chaotic parameters"", a
large third state called half-chaos exists, which simultaneously exhibit small
(ordered) and large (chaotic) reactions for small disturbances in similar
share. The discovery of half-chaos frees modeling of adapted systems from sharp
restrictions; it allows to use ""chaotic parameters"" and get a nearly stable
system more similar to modeled one. It gives a base for identity criterion of
an evolving object, simplifies the definition of basic Darwinian mechanism and
changes ""life on the edge of chaos"" to ""life evolves in the half-chaos of not
fully random systems"".

introduced. In the present paper we present a natural extension of this space
to non-planar pentagon functions. This provides the basis for our pentagon
bootstrap program. We classify the relevant functions up to weight four, which
is relevant for two-loop scattering amplitudes. We constrain the first entry of
the symbol of the functions using information on branch cuts. Drawing on an
analogy from the planar case, we introduce a conjectural second-entry condition
on the symbol. We then show that the information on the function space, when
complemented with some additional insights, can be used to efficiently
bootstrap individual Feynman integrals. The extra information is read off of
Mellin-Barnes representations of the integrals, either by evaluating simple
asymptotic limits, or by taking discontinuities in the kinematic variables. We
use this method to evaluate the symbols of two non-trivial non-planar
five-particle integrals, up to and including the finite part.

amplifiers (LNAs) can be substantial because of the many antennas. We
investigate the feasibility of inexpensive, power efficient LNAs, which
inherently are less linear. A polynomial model is used to characterize the
nonlinear LNAs and to derive the second-order statistics and spatial
correlation of the distortion. We show that, with spatial matched filtering
(maximum-ratio combining) at the receiver, some distortion terms combine
coherently, and that the SINR of the symbol estimates therefore is limited by
the linearity of the LNAs. Furthermore, it is studied how the power from a
blocker in the adjacent frequency band leaks into the main band and creates
distortion. The distortion term that scales cubically with the power received
from the blocker has a spatial correlation that can be filtered out by spatial
processing and only the coherent term that scales quadratically with the power
remains. When the blocker is in free-space line-of-sight and the LNAs are
identical, this quadratic term has the same spatial direction as the desired
signal, and hence cannot be removed by linear receiver processing.

Internet, computer networks, global information exchange, and its positive

of penetration and intrusion which forms a high risk to the security of
information organizations, government agencies, and causes large economic
losses. There are many techniques designed for protection such as firewall and
intrusion detection systems (IDS). IDS is a set of software and/or hardware
techniques used to detect hacker's activities in computer systems. Two types of
anomalies are used in IDS to detect intrusive activities different from normal
user behavior. Misuse relies on the knowledge base that contains all known
attack techniques and intrusion is discovered through research in this
knowledge base. Artificial intelligence techniques have been introduced to
improve the performance of these systems. The importance of IDS is to identify
unauthorized access attempting to compromise confidentiality, integrity or
availability of the computer network. This paper investigates the Intrusion
Detection (ID) problem using three machine learning algorithms namely, BayesNet
algorithm, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The
algorithms are applied on a real, Management Information Based (MIB) dataset
that is collected from real life environment. To enhance the detection process
accuracy, a set of feature selection approaches is used; Infogain (IG), ReleifF
(RF), and Genetic Search (GS). Our experiments show that the three feature
selection methods have enhanced the classification performance. GS with
bayesNet, MLP and SVM give high accuracy rates, more specifically the BayesNet
with the GS accuracy rate is 99.9%.

memory access impacts performance. In this paper, we propose algorithmic
improvements to cuckoo hash tables allowing to eliminate some unnecessary
memory accesses; these changes are conducted without altering the properties of
the original cuckoo hash table so that all existing theoretical analysis remain

decompositions, such as $O(n^{\omega+\epsilon})$ time matrix multiplication,
and in addition many other algorithms such as $O(n \log n)$ time discrete
Fourier transform and $O^*(2^n)$ time for computing the permanent of a matrix.
However tensor networks sometimes yield faster algorithms than those that
follow from low-rank decompositions. For instance the fastest known
$O(n^{(\omega +\epsilon)t})$ time algorithms for counting $3t$-cliques can be
implemented with tensor networks, even though the underlying tensor has border
rank $n^{3t}$ for all $t \ge 2$. For counting homomorphisms of a general
pattern graph $P$ into a host graph on $n$ vertices we obtain an upper bound of
$O(n^{(\omega+\epsilon)\operatorname{bw}(P)/2})$ where $\operatorname{bw}(P)$
is the branchwidth of $P$. This essentially matches the bound for counting
cliques, and yields small improvements over previous algorithms for many
choices of $P$.
  While powerful, the model still has limitations, and we are able to show a
number of unconditional lower bounds for various multilinear maps, including:
  (a) an $\Omega(n^{\operatorname{bw}(P)})$ time lower bound for counting
homomorphisms from $P$ to an $n$-vertex graph, matching the upper bound if
$\omega = 2$. In particular for $P$ a $v$-clique this yields an
$\Omega(n^{\lceil 2v/3 \rceil})$ time lower bound for counting $v$-cliques, and
for $P$ a $k$-uniform $v$-hyperclique we obtain an $\Omega(n^v)$ time lower
bound for $k \ge 3$, ruling out tensor networks as an approach to obtaining
non-trivial algorithms for hyperclique counting and the Max-$3$-CSP problem.

challenge. The main obstacles originate from the small number of molecular
classes investigated as well as from the absence of an efficient strategy
aiming at the maximization of polariton states population. Here we report on
bright polariton organic light emitting diodes made of a coumarin fluorescent
dye emitting layer, working in the ultra-strong coupling regime up to a
coupling strength of 33%. Owing to a high radiative decay emission, a large
Stokes shift and a fine cavity-exciton tuning, the radiative pumping mechanism
of polariton states has been fully optimized, leading a large portion (25%) of
the emissive electrically pumped excitons to be converted in polariton
emission. The resulting polariton OLEDs showed electro-optical performances up
to 0.2% of external quantum efficiency and 700 cd/m2 of luminance,
corresponding to the highest values reported so far for this class of devices.
Our work gives clear indications for an effective exploitation of organic

the surface energy, DeltaR the clearance and R the radius of the sphere, the

present a novel quantile Fourier neural network is for nonparametric

provided in the form of composite quantiles using time as the only input to the

regression applied for forecasting. Experiments are conducted on eight real
world datasets that demonstrate a variety of periodic and aperiodic patterns.
Nine naive and advanced methods are used as benchmarks including quantile

exponential smoothing. The obtained empirical results validate the
effectiveness of the proposed method in providing high quality and accurate

and $\sim 150$ keV has been observed in nearly ten magnetars. For
inner-magnetospheric models of such emission, resonant inverse Compton
scattering of soft thermal photons by ultra-relativistic charges is the most
efficient production mechanism. We present angle-dependent upscattering spectra
and pulsed intensity maps for uncooled, relativistic electrons injected in
inner regions of magnetar magnetospheres, calculated using collisional
integrals over field loops. Our computations employ a new formulation of the
QED Compton scattering cross section in strong magnetic fields that is
physically correct for treating important spin-dependent effects in the
cyclotron resonance, thereby producing correct photon spectra. The spectral
cut-off energies are sensitive to the choices of observer viewing geometry,
electron Lorentz factor, and scattering kinematics. We find that electrons with
energies $\lesssim 15$ MeV will emit most of their radiation below 250 keV,
consistent with inferred turnovers for magnetar hard X-ray tails. More
energetic electrons still emit mostly below 1 MeV, except for viewing
perspectives sampling field line tangents. Pulse profiles may be singly- or
doubly-peaked dependent upon viewing geometry, emission locale, and observed
energy band. Magnetic pair production and photon splitting will attenuate
spectra to hard X-ray energies, suppressing signals in the Fermi-LAT band. The
resonant Compton spectra are strongly polarized, suggesting that hard X-ray
polarimetry instruments such as X-Calibur, or a future Compton telescope, can
prove central to constraining model geometry and physics.

we analyze include: (i) two basic forms of two-time-scale gradient-based TD
algorithms, which we call GTD and which minimize the mean squared projected
Bellman error using stochastic gradient-descent; (ii) their ""robustified""
biased variants; (iii) their mirror-descent versions which combine the
mirror-descent idea with TD learning; and (iv) a single-time-scale version of
GTD that solves minimax problems formulated for approximate policy evaluation.
  We derive convergence results for three types of stepsizes: constant
stepsize, slowly diminishing stepsize, as well as the standard type of
diminishing stepsize with a square-summable condition. For the first two types
of stepsizes, we apply the weak convergence method from stochastic
approximation theory to characterize the asymptotic behavior of the algorithms,
and for the standard type of stepsize, we analyze the algorithmic behavior with
respect to a stronger mode of convergence, almost sure convergence. Our
convergence results are for the aforementioned TD algorithms with three general
ways of setting their $\lambda$-parameters: (i) state-dependent $\lambda$; (ii)
a recently proposed scheme of using history-dependent $\lambda$ to keep the
eligibility traces of the algorithms bounded while allowing for relatively
large values of $\lambda$; and (iii) a composite scheme of setting the
$\lambda$-parameters that combines the preceding two schemes and allows a
broader class of generalized Bellman operators to be used for approximate
policy evaluation with TD methods.

properties ($\rm{H_2}\;$column densities, dust temperatures, morphologies,
radial column density profiles) and kinematics of large-scale filaments in the
literature. We expand and improve upon prior analyses by using the same data
sets, techniques, and spiral arm models to disentangle the filaments' inherent
properties from selection criteria and methodology. Our results suggest that
the myriad filament finding techniques are uncovering different physical
structures, with length ($11-269\,\rm\,pc$), width ($1-40\,\rm\,pc$), mass
($\rm3\times10^3\; M_\odot-1.1\times10^{6}\;M_\odot$), aspect ratio
(3:1-117:1), and high column density fraction ($0.2-100\%$) varying by over an
order of magnitude across the sample of 45 filaments. We develop a radial
profile fitting code, $\texttt{RadFil}$, which is publicly available. We also
perform a $\textit{position-position-velocity}$ ($\textit{p-p-v}$) analysis on
a subsample and find that while $60-70\%$ lie spatially in the plane of the
Galaxy, only $30-45\%$ concurrently exhibit spatial $\textit{and}$ kinematic
proximity to spiral arms. In a parameter space defined by aspect ratio, dust
temperature, and column density, we broadly distinguish three filament

Highly elongated ""Bone-like"" filaments show the most potential for tracing

FWHM, of the broad emission line, i.e. $L_{\rm X}\propto L_{\rm

selected non-jetted quasars in the redshift range of 0.36-2.23 from the Sloan

found that the additional dependence of the observed $L_{\rm X}-L_{\rm UV}$

significant. Our statistical analysis leads to a much tighter relation with
respect to the one neglecting FWHM, and it does not evolve with redshift. We
interpret this new relation within an accretion disc corona scenario where
reconnection and magnetic loops above the accretion disc can account for the
production of the primary X-ray radiation. For a broad line region size
depending on the disc luminosity as $R_{\rm blr}\propto L_{\rm disc}^{0.5}$, we
find that $L_{\rm X}\propto L_{\rm UV}^{4/7} ~FWHM^{4/7}$, which is in very

distribution $P\!\left(X,Y\right)$ and maps the data $X$ to cluster labels $T$
which retain maximal information about $Y$ (Tishby et al., 1999). This
objective results in an algorithm that clusters data points based upon the
similarity of their conditional distributions $P\!\left(Y\mid X\right)$. This
is in contrast to classic ""geometric clustering'' algorithms such as $k$-means
and gaussian mixture models (GMMs) which take a set of observed data points
$\left\{ \mathbf{x}_{i}\right\} _{i=1:N}$ and cluster them based upon their
geometric (typically Euclidean) distance from one another. Here, we show how to
use the deterministic information bottleneck (DIB) (Strouse and Schwab, 2017),
a variant of IB, to perform geometric clustering, by choosing cluster labels
that preserve information about data point location on a smoothed dataset. We
also introduce a novel method to choose the number of clusters, based on
identifying solutions where the tradeoff between number of clusters used and
spatial information preserved is strongest. We apply this approach to a variety
of simple clustering problems, showing that DIB with our model selection
procedure recovers the generative cluster labels. We also show that, in
particular limits of our model parameters, clustering with DIB and IB is
equivalent to $k$-means and EM fitting of a GMM with hard and soft assignments,
respectively. Thus, clustering with (D)IB generalizes and provides an
information-theoretic perspective on these classic algorithms.

network representation not only creates a more accurate representation of the
underlying complex system, but also leads to more accurate network analysis. In
this paper, we first present a scalable and accurate model, BuildHON+, for
higher-order network representation of data derived from a complex system with
various orders of dependencies. Then, we show that this higher-order network
representation modeled by BuildHON+ is significantly more accurate in
identifying anomalies than FON, demonstrating a need for the higher-order
network representation and modeling of complex systems for deriving meaningful
conclusions.

analysis in Pb-Pb collisions at the beam energy of 40$A$~GeV recorded with the
fixed target experiment NA49 at the CERN SPS are presented. The three-subevent
technique is used for the differential measurements of the directed and

transverse plane are applied using an extension of the Qn-Corrections Framework
developed originally for the ALICE experiment at the LHC. The results are
compared with those previously published by the STAR at RHIC and the NA49 at

nodes ($k$ of which are terminals) are connected through components which are
subject to random failure and repair processes. At any time, a system failure
occurs if the surviving system fails to connect all the k terminals together.
We assume that each component's up-times and down-times follow statistically
independent stationary random processes, and these processes are statistically
independent across the components. In this setting, the exact computation of
failure frequency is known to be computationally intractable (NP-hard). In this
work, we present an algorithm to approximate the failure frequency for any
given multiplicative error factor that runs in polynomial time in the number of
(minimal) cutsets. Moreover, for the special case of all-terminal reliability
systems, i.e., where all nodes are terminals, we propose an algorithm for
approximating the failure frequency within an arbitrary multiplicative error
that runs in polynomial time in the number of nodes (which can be much smaller
than the number of cutsets). In addition, our simulation results confirm that
the proposed method is much faster and more accurate than the Monte Carlo

(MZ) formalism of Statistical Mechanics with the Variational Multiscale (VMS)
method. The MZ-VMS approach leverages both VMS scale-separation projectors as
well as phase-space projectors to provide a systematic modeling approach that
is applicable to non-linear partial differential equations. Spectral as well as
continuous and discontinuous finite element methods are considered. The
framework leads to a formally closed equation in which the effect of the
unresolved scales on the resolved scales is non-local in time and appears as a
convolution or memory integral. The resulting non-Markovian system is used as a
starting point for model development. We discover that unresolved scales lead
to memory effects that are driven by an orthogonal projection of the
coarse-scale residual and inter-element jumps. It is further shown that an
MZ-based finite memory model is a variant of the well-known
adjoint-stabilization method. For hyperbolic equations, this stabilization is
shown to have the form of an artificial viscosity term. We further establish
connections between the memory kernel and approximate Riemann solvers. It is
demonstrated that, in the case of one-dimensional linear advection, the
assumption of a finite memory and a linear quadrature leads to a closure term
that is formally equivalent to an upwind flux correction.

aware of a practical algorithm that can enumerate such annotation spaces for a
given ontology. In this work we propose an algorithm for enumerating consistent
subgraphs of directed acyclic graphs. The algorithm recursively partitions the
graph into strictly smaller graphs until the resulting graph becomes a rooted
tree (forest), for which a linear-time solution is computed. It then combines
the tallies from graphs created in the recursion to obtain the final count. We
prove the correctness of this algorithm and then apply it to characterize four
major biomedical ontologies. We believe this work provides valuable insights
into concept annotation spaces and predictability of ontological annotation.

$\alpha$-attractor models with dynamical dark energy, including the
cosmological constant $\Lambda$ as a free parameter. Predominantly, the models
with $\Lambda > 0$ converge to the asymptotic regime with the equation of state
$w=-1$. However, there are some models with $w\neq -1$, which are compatible
with the current observations. In the simplest models with $\Lambda = 0$, one
has the tensor to scalar ratio $r=\frac{12\alpha}{N^2}$ and the asymptotic
equation of state $w=-1+\frac{2}{9\alpha}$ (which in general differs from its
present value). For example, in the seven disk M-theory related model with
$\alpha = 7/3$ one finds $r \sim 10^{-2}$ and the asymptotic equation of state
is $w \sim -0.9$. Future observations, including large-scale structure surveys
as well as B-mode detectors will test these, as well as more general models
presented here. We also discuss gravitational reheating in models of
quintessential inflation and argue that its investigation may be interesting
from the point of view of inflationary cosmology. Such models require a much
greater number of $e$-folds, and therefore predict a spectral index $n_{s}$
that can exceed the value in more conventional models by about $0.006$. This
suggests a way to distinguish the conventional inflationary models from the

What if they had? I build an empirical, quantitative model of this
counterfactual hypothesis using pairwise maximum entropy. I infer how 36
justices from 1946-2016 would have all voted on a Super Supreme Court. The
model is strikingly consistent with a standard voting model from political
science despite using $10^5$ less parameters and fitting the observed
statistics better. As with historical courts, the Super Court is dominated by
consensus. The rate at which consensus decays as more justices are included is
extremely slow, nearly 100 years, and indicates that the modern Supreme Court
is an extremely stable institution. Beyond consensus, I discover a rich
structure of dissenting blocs that are distributed along a heavy-tailed Zipf's
law. The heavy tail means that dominant dissenting modes fail to capture the
entire spectrum of dissent. Thus, I find that Supreme Court voting over time is
not low-dimensional despite implications to the contrary in historical analysis
of Supreme Court voting. Although it has been long presumed that strong higher
order correlations are induced by features of the cases, the institution, and
the justices, I show that such complexity can be expressed in a minimal model
relying only on pairwise correlations. From the perspective of model selection,
this minimal model may generalize better and thus be useful for prediction of
Supreme Court voting over time.

conditions from a feasible solution to an arbitrary one for the derived
Evolution Partial Differential Equation (EPDE). To guarantee the validity, an
unconstrained Lyapunov functional that has the same minimum as the original OCP
is constructed, and it ensures the evolution towards the optimal solution from
infeasible solutions. With the semi-discrete method, the EPDE is transformed to
the finite-dimensional Initial-value Problem (IVP), and then solved with common
Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) numerical integration methods.

However, identifying and representing these eigenfunctions has proven to be
mathematically and computationally challenging. This work leverages the power

Allender introduced the concept of ""low for speed"" oracles. An oracle A is low
for speed if relativizing to A has essentially no effect on computational
complexity, meaning that if a decidable language can be decided in time $f(n)$
with access to oracle A, then it can be decided in time poly(f(n)) without any
oracle. The existence of non-computable such A's was later proven by Bayer and
Slaman, who even constructed a computably enumerable one, and exhibited a
number of properties of these oracles as well as interesting connections with
computability theory. In this paper, we pursue this line of research, answering
the questions left by Bayer and Slaman and give further evidence that the
structure of the class of low for speed oracles is a very rich one.

complex systems which describes systems in terms of intrinsic computation,
identifying computational primitives of information storage and transfer. In
this paper we make a formal analogy between information dynamics and stochastic
thermodynamics which describes the thermal behaviour of small irreversible
systems. As stochastic dynamics is increasingly being utilized to quantify the
thermodynamics associated with the processing of information we suggest such an
analogy is instructive, highlighting that existing thermodynamic quantities can
be described solely in terms of extant information theoretic measures related
to information processing. In this contribution we construct irreversibility
measures in terms of these quantities and relate them to the physical entropy
productions that characterise the behaviour of single and composite systems in
stochastic thermodynamics illustrating them with simple examples. Moreover, we
can apply such a formalism to systems which do not have a bipartite structure.
In particular we demonstrate that, given suitable non-bipartite processes, the
heat flow in a subsystem can still be identified and one requires the present
formalism to recover generalizations of the second law. In these systems
residual irreversibility is associated with neither subsystem and this must be
included in the these generalised second laws. This opens up the possibility of
describing all physical systems in terms of computation allowing us to propose
a framework for discussing the reversibility of systems traditionally out of
scope of stochastic thermodynamics.

on-board sensors but must be deduced by combining measurements of correlated

passively gather data along prescribed paths, while inference, path planning,
and other high level decision making is largely performed by a supervisory
science team. However, communication constraints hinder these processes, and
hence the rate of scientific progress. This paper presents an active perception
approach that aims to reduce robots' reliance on human supervision and improve
science productivity by encoding scientists' domain knowledge and decision
making process on-board. We use Bayesian networks to compactly model critical
aspects of scientific knowledge while remaining robust to observation and
modeling uncertainty. We then formulate path planning and sensor scheduling as
an information gain maximization problem, and propose a sampling-based solution
based on Monte Carlo tree search to plan informative sensing actions which
exploit the knowledge encoded in the network. The computational complexity of
our framework does not grow with the number of observations taken and allows
long horizon planning in an anytime manner, making it highly applicable to
field robotics. Simulation results show statistically significant performance
improvements over baseline methods, and we validate the practicality of our
approach through both hardware experiments and simulated experiments with field
data gathered during the NASA Mojave Volatiles Prospector science expedition.

evaluate the speed of ASYMP, where we show that across a diverse selection of

A natural problem is to determine the number of characters that need to be
queried (i.e. the decision tree complexity) in a string in order to decide
whether this string contains a certain pattern. Rivest showed that for every
pattern $p$, in the worst case any deterministic algorithm needs to query at
least $n-|p|+1$ characters, where $n$ is the length of the string and $|p|$ is
the length of the pattern. He further conjectured that this bound is tight. By
using the adversary method, Tuza disproved this conjecture and showed that more
than one half of binary patterns are {\em evasive}, i.e. any algorithm needs to
query all the characters (see Section 1.1 for more details).
  In this paper, we give a query algorithm which settles the decision tree
complexity of string matching except for a negligible fraction of patterns. Our
algorithm shows that Tuza's criteria of evasive patterns are almost complete.
Using the algebraic approach of Rivest and Vuillemin, we also give a new
sufficient condition for the evasiveness of patterns, which is beyond Tuza's
criteria. In addition, our result reveals an interesting connection to
\emph{Skolem's Problem} in mathematics.

Considering both the zigzag and armchair terminals, we confirm that the zigzag
terminals are the better choice for detecting the Andreev reflection without no
external field. Due to scattering from the boundaries of the finite-size centre
region, the difference between Andreev retroreflection and specular reflection
is hard to be distinguished. Although adjusting the size of the device makes
the difference visible, to distinguish them quantitatively is still impossible
through the transport conductance. The problem is circumvented when applying a
perpendicular magnetic field on the centre region, which makes the incident
electrons and the reflected holes propagate along the edge or the interface. In
this case, the retroreflected and specular reflected holes from the different
bands have opposite effective masses, therefore the moving direction of one is
opposite to the other. Which external terminal the reflected holes flow into
depends entirely on the kind of the Andreev reflection. Therefore, the specular
Andreev reflection can be clearly distinguished from the retroreflected one in
the presence of strong magnetic field, even for the device with finite size.

over-shoot a local minimum during inflation. We provide an example of a quintic
polynomial potential that implements this idea and leads to the observed
spectral index, observed amplitude of fluctuations on large scales, significant
PBH formation on small scales, and is compatible with other observational

we develop a system that helps users choose criterion weights that lead to

  We consider ranking functions that compute the score of each item as a
weighted sum of (numeric) attribute values, and then sort items on their score.
Each ranking function can be expressed as a vector of weights, or as a point in
a multi-dimensional space. For a broad range of fairness criteria, we show how
to efficiently identify regions in this space that satisfy these criteria.
Using this identification method, our system is able to tell users whether
their proposed ranking function satisfies the desired fairness criteria and, if
it does not, to suggest the smallest modification that does. We develop
user-controllable approximation that and indexing techniques that are applied
during preprocessing, and support sub-second response times during the online

experimental manifestations of {\alpha}-clustering in nuclei. This is obtained
by relating the theoretical descriptions of clustering states with experimental

  Purpose: Our goal is to probe the {\alpha}-clustering in $^{10}$Be nucleus by
proton-induced {\alpha}-knockout reaction observables.
  Method: We adopt an extended version of the Tohsaki-Horiuchi-Schuck-R\""opke
(THSR) wave function of $^{10}$Be and integrate it with the distorted wave
impulse approximation (DWIA) framework for the calculation of (p,p{\alpha})
knockout reactions.
  Results: We make the first calculation for the $^{10}$Be(p,p{\alpha})$^{6}$He
reaction at 250 MeV implementing a microscopic {\alpha}-cluster wave function
and predict the triple differential cross sections (TDX). Furthermore, by
constructing artificial states of the target nucleus $^{10}$Be with compact or

in strong shocks that are capable of accelerating cosmic rays (CRs) to
$\sim10~\rm PeV$. These shocks will produce high-energy neutrinos and
$\gamma$-rays through inelastic $pp$ collisions with ambient gaseous
environments. In this work, we study the contributions of these halo mergers to
the diffuse neutrino flux measured in IceCube and to the non-blazar portion of
the extragalactic $\gamma$-ray background measured by $Fermi$. In order to
calculate them, we formulate the redshift dependence of the shock velocity,
galactic radius, halo gas content and galactic/intergalactic magnetic fields
over the dark matter halo distribution up to a redshift $z=10$. We find that
high-redshift mergers contribute a significant amount of the cosmic-ray energy
luminosity density, and the resulting neutrino spectra could explain a large
part of the observed diffuse neutrino flux above 0.1 PeV up to several PeV. We
also show that our model can somewhat alleviate tensions with the extragalactic
$\gamma$-ray background. First, since a larger fraction of the CR energy
luminosity density comes from high redshifts, the accompanying $\gamma$-rays
are more strongly suppressed through $\gamma\gamma$ annihilations with the
cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the extragalactic background light (EBL).
Second, mildly radiative-cooled shocks may lead to a harder CR spectrum with
spectral indices of $1.5\lesssim s\lesssim2.0$. Our study suggests that halo
mergers, a fraction of which may also induce starbursts in the merged galaxies,
can be promising neutrino emitters without violating the existing $Fermi$
$\gamma$-ray constraints on the non-blazar component of the extragalactic
$\gamma$-ray background.

It is used for a description of direct CR measurements and associated

accounting for all relevant observables at a time, the GALPROP code brings
together theoretical predictions, interpretation of the most recent

paper we review latest applications of GALPROP and address ongoing and near

used high-resolution optical spectra obtained in different years to model the

LHA 120-S 35 displays spectral variability in both optical and IR regions. The
P-Cygni line profiles of H I, as well as those of Fe II and O I, suggest the
presence of a strong bipolar clumped wind. We distinguish density enhancements
in the P-Cygni absorption component of the first Balmer lines, which show
variations in both velocity and strength. The P-Cygni profile emission
component is double-peaked, indicating the presence of a rotating CS disc. We
also observe line-profile variations in the permitted and forbidden features of
Fe II and O I. In the IR, we detect variations in the intensity of the H I
emission lines as well as in the emission of the CO band-heads. Moreover, we
find that the profiles of each [Ca II] and [O I] emission lines contain
contributions from spatially different (complete or partial) rings. Globally,
we find evidence of detached multi-ring structures, revealing density
variations along the disc. We suggest that LHA 120-S 35 has passed through the
red-supergiant (RSG) phase and evolves back bluewards in the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The formation of the complex CS structure could be
the result of the wind-wind interactions of the post-RSG wind with the
previously ejected material from the RSG. However, the presence of a binary
companion can not be excluded. Finally, we find that LHA 120-S 35 belongs to a
young stellar cluster.

partition the data into a large number of subsets, apply a readily available
Bayesian spatial process model on every subset, in parallel, and optimally
combine the posterior distributions estimated across all the subsets into a
pseudo-posterior distribution that conditions on the entire data. The combined
pseudo posterior distribution replaces the full data posterior distribution for
predicting the responses at arbitrary locations and for inference on the model
parameters and spatial surface. Based on distributed Bayesian inference, our
approach is called ""Distributed Kriging"" (DISK) and offers significant
advantages in massive data applications where the full data are stored across
multiple machines. We show theoretically that the Bayes $L_2$-risk of the DISK
posterior distribution achieves the near optimal convergence rate in estimating
the true spatial surface with various types of covariance functions, and
provide upper bounds for the number of subsets as a function of the full sample
size. The model-free feature of DISK is demonstrated by scaling posterior
computations in spatial process models with a stationary full-rank and a
nonstationary low-rank Gaussian process (GP) prior. A variety of simulations

validate our theoretical results.

discussed. The calculation is performed exactly in the parameters of the atomic
field. Though the Coulomb corrections to the cross sections, related to the
multiple Coulomb exchange of $\mu^+,\,\mu^-$ and an atom, are negligible, the
Coulomb corrections to the differential cross sections, related to the electron
interaction with an atom, are large. However, the latter Coulomb corrections to

Apparently, this effect can easily be observed experimentally. Furthermore, it
is shown that the asymmetry of the cross section with respect to the

EEGs can reduce time to diagnosis and enhance real-time applications such as
ICU monitoring. Clinicians have indicated that a sensitivity of 95% with a
specificity below 5% was the minimum requirement for clinical acceptance. We
propose a highperformance classification system based on principles of big data
and machine learning. Methods: A hybrid machine learning system that uses
hidden Markov models (HMM) for sequential decoding and deep learning networks
for postprocessing is proposed. These algorithms were trained and evaluated
using the TUH EEG Corpus, which is the world's largest publicly available
database of clinical EEG data. Results: Our approach delivers a sensitivity
above 90% while maintaining a specificity below 5%. This system detects three
events of clinical interest: (1) spike and/or sharp waves, (2) periodic
lateralized epileptiform discharges, (3) generalized periodic epileptiform
discharges. It also detects three events used to model background noise: (1)
artifacts, (2) eye movement (3) background. Conclusions: A hybrid HMM/deep
learning system can deliver a low false alarm rate on EEG event detection,
making automated analysis a viable option for clinicians. Significance: The TUH
EEG Corpus enables application of highly data consumptive machine learning
algorithms to EEG analysis. Performance is approaching clinical acceptance for
real-time applications.

the nuclear response to isospin transferring external fields. One of the most
studied excitation modes is the Gamow-Teller resonance (GTR), which can,
therefore, be used as a sensitive test for the theoretical approaches. Its
low-energy part, which is responsible for the beta decay half-lives, is
especially convenient for this. Models benchmarked against the GTR can be used
to predict other, more exotic, excitations studied at nuclear rare isotope beam

boundary of each block instead of solving the connectivity of all the pixels.
With the proposed method, the length of label-equivalence lists is compressed,
and the number of memory accesses is reduced. Thus, the efficiency of connected
components labeling is improved. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms the other approaches between $29\%$ and $80\%$ on average.

at which the linearized systems are not controllable. For finite dimensional
control systems, the authors recently classified the possible quadratic
behaviors. Quadratic terms introduce coercive drifts in the dynamics,
quantified by integer negative Sobolev norms, which are linked to Lie brackets
and which prevent smooth small-time local controllability for the full
nonlinear system.
  In the context of nonlinear parabolic equations, we prove that the same
obstructions persist. More importantly, we prove that two new behaviors occur,
which are impossible in finite dimension. First, there exists a continuous
family of quadratic obstructions quantified by fractional negative Sobolev
norms or by weighted variations of them. Second, and more strikingly,
small-time local null controllability can sometimes be recovered from the
quadratic expansion. We also construct a system for which an infinite number of
directions are recovered using a quadratic expansion.
  As in the finite dimensional case, the relation between the regularity of the
controls and the strength of the possible quadratic obstructions plays a key
role in our analysis.

computing. In order to reduce security vulnerabilities, public cloud providers
offer firewall functionalities. When properly configured, a firewall protects
cloud networks from cyber-attacks. However, proper firewall configuration
requires intimate knowledge of the protected system, high expertise and
on-going maintenance.
  As a result, many organizations do not use firewalls effectively, leaving
their cloud resources vulnerable. In this paper, we present a novel supervised
learning method, and prototype, which compute recommendations for firewall
rules. Recommendations are based on sampled network traffic meta-data (NetFlow)
collected from a public cloud provider. Labels are extracted from firewall
configurations deemed to be authored by experts. NetFlow is collected from
network routers, avoiding expensive collection from cloud VMs, as well as
relieving privacy concerns.
  The proposed method captures network routines and dependencies between
resources and firewall configuration. The method predicts IPs to be allowed by
the firewall. A grouping algorithm is subsequently used to generate a
manageable number of IP ranges. Each range is a parameter for a firewall rule.
  We present results of experiments on real data, showing ROC AUC of 0.92,

formulae act like programs and also have smells. One well recognized common
smell of spreadsheet formulae is nest-IF expressions, which have low
readability and high cognitive cost for users, and are error-prone during reuse
or maintenance. However, end users usually lack essential programming language
knowledge and skills to tackle or even realize the problem. The previous
research work has made very initial attempts in this aspect, while no effective
and automated approach is currently available.
  This paper firstly proposes an AST-based automated approach to systematically
refactoring nest-IF formulae. The general idea is two-fold. First, we detect
and remove logic redundancy on the AST. Second, we identify higher-level
semantics that have been fragmented and scattered, and reassemble the syntax
using concise built-in functions. A comprehensive evaluation has been conducted
against a real-world spreadsheet corpus, which is collected in a leading IT
company for research purpose. The results with over 68,000 spreadsheets with 27
million nest-IF formulae reveal that our approach is able to relieve the smell
of over 99\% of nest-IF formulae. Over 50% of the refactorings have reduced
nesting levels of the nest-IFs by more than a half. In addition, a survey
involving 49 participants indicates that for most cases the participants prefer
the refactored formulae, and agree on that such automated refactoring approach
is necessary and helpful.

Synchronization and communication among processors involve high cost. Software

concurrent programs with great ease. Different concurrent operations that need
to be composed to form a single atomic unit is achieved by encapsulating them
in a single transaction. In this paper, we introduce a new STM system as
multi-version object based STM (MVOSTM) which is the combination of both of
these ideas for harnessing greater concurrency in STMs. As the name suggests
MVOSTM, works on a higher level and maintains multiple versions corresponding

corresponding to each key. In addition to that, we have developed garbage
collection for MVOSTM (MVOSTM-GC) to delete unwanted versions corresponding to
the keys to reduce traversal overhead. MVOSTM provides greater concurrency
while reducing the number of aborts and it ensures compositionality by making
the transactions atomic. Here, we have used MVOSTM for the list and hash-table

global information available from theoretical CMB covariance matrix as well as
from the data. Since we apply our method over the large scale on the sky

our methods on low resolution Planck and WMAP foreground contaminated CMB maps

Our cleaned CMB map and its power spectrum have significantly less error than
those obtained following usual ILC technique at low resolution that does not

multipoles because of effective suppression of CMB-foreground chance
correlations on large angular scales of the sky. Our cleaned CMB map and its

Degenerate scenario. Our results are valid also for all the evolutionary
scenarios invoking rotation as the driving mechanism of the accretion process
as well as the evolution up to the explosion. We find that the observational
properties depend mainly on the mass of the exploding object, even if the
angular momentum evolution after the end of the mass accretion phase and before
the onset of C-burning plays a non-negligible role. Just before the explosion
the magnitude M_V ranges between 9 and 11 mag, while the colour (F225W-F555W)
is about -1.64 mag. The photometric properties remain constant for a few
decades before the explosion. During the last few months the luminosity
decreases very rapidly. The corresponding decline in the optical bands varies
from few hundredths up to one magnitude, the exact value depending on both the
WD total mass and the braking efficiency at the end of the mass transfer. This
feature is related to the exponentially increasing energy production which
drives the formation of a convective core rapidly extending over a large part
of the exploding object. Also a drop in the angular velocity occurs. We find
that observations in the soft X band (0.5 -2 keV) may be used to check if the
SNe Ia progenitors evolution up to explosion is driven by rotation and, hence,
to discriminate among different progenitor scenarios.

developments in polynomial-degree-robust a posteriori error analysis, we solve
two types of discrete local problems on vertex-based patches. The first type
involves the solution on each patch of a mixed finite element problem with
homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, which leads to an ${\mathbf
H}(\mathrm{div},\Omega)$-conforming equilibrated flux. This, in turn, yields a
guaranteed upper bound on the error and serves to mark mesh vertices for
refinement via D\""orfler's bulk-chasing criterion. The second type of local
problems involves the solution, on patches associated with marked vertices
only, of two separate primal finite element problems with homogeneous Dirichlet
boundary conditions, which serve to decide between $h$-, $p$-, or
$hp$-refinement. Altogether, we show that these ingredients lead to a
computable guaranteed bound on the ratio of the errors between successive
refinements (error reduction factor). In a series of numerical experiments
featuring smooth and singular solutions, we study the performance of the
proposed $hp$-adaptive strategy and observe exponential convergence rates. We
also investigate the accuracy of our bound on the reduction factor by
evaluating the ratio of the predicted reduction factor relative to the true
error reduction, and we find that this ratio is in general quite close to the
optimal value of one.

an important ingredient of the longstanding question about the mechanism of the
interplanetary plasma heating. Previous studies have shown that
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is statistically compatible with the
observed solar wind heating as it expands in the heliosphere. However, in order
to understand which processes contribute to the plasma heating, it is necessary
to have a local description of the energy flux across scales. To this aim, it
is customary to use indicators such as the magnetic field partial variance of
increments (PVI), which is associated with the local, relative, scale-dependent
magnetic energy. A more complete evaluation of the energy transfer should also
include other terms, related to velocity and cross-helicity. This is achieved
here by introducing a proxy for the local, scale dependent turbulent energy
transfer rate epsilon_Dt(t), based on the third-order moment scaling law for
MHD turbulence. Data from Helios 2 are used to determine the statistical
properties of such a proxy in comparison with the magnetic and velocity fields
PVI, and the correlation with local solar wind heating is computed. PVI and
epsilon_Dt(t) are generally well correlated, however epsilon_Dt(t) is a very
sensitive proxy that can exhibit large amplitude values, both positive and
negative, even for low amplitude peaks in the PVI. Furthermore, epsilon_Dt(t)
is very well correlated with local increases of temperature when large
amplitude bursts of energy transfer are localized, thus suggesting an important
role played by this proxy in the study of plasma energy dissipation.

a four-component pipeline, which obtains as input a training corpus of

same domain, and generates as output a set of factoid questions that refer to
the source sentences but are slightly different from them, so that a

deeper understanding and knowledge than a simple word-matching. Contrary to
existing domain-specific AQG systems that utilize the template-based approach

binary spacetimes in the era of gravitational wave astronomy, we reexamine
hyperbolicity and well-posedness of the initial value problem for popular
models of general relativistic fluids. Our analysis relies heavily on the
dual-frame formalism, which allows us to work in the Lagrangian frame, where
computation is relatively easy, before transforming to the desired Eulerian
form. This general strategy allows for the construction of compact expressions
for the characteristic variables in a highly economical manner. General
relativistic hydrodynamics (GRHD), ideal magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) and
resistive magnetohydrodynamics (RGRMHD) are considered in turn. In the first
case we obtain a simplified form of earlier expressions. In the second we show
that the flux-balance law formulation used in typical numerical applications is
only weakly hyperbolic and thus does not have a well-posed initial value
problem. Newtonian ideal MHD is found to suffer from the same problem when
written in flux-balance law form. An alternative formulation, closely related
to that of Anile and Pennisi, is instead shown to be strongly hyperbolic. In
the final case we find that the standard forms of RGRMHD, relying upon a
particular choice of `generalized Ohm's law', are only weakly hyperbolic. The
latter problem may be rectified by adjusting the choice of Ohm's law, but we do
not do so here. Along the way weak hyperbolicity of the field equations for
dust and charged dust is also observed. More sophisticated systems, such as
multi-fluid and elastic models are also expected to be amenable to our
treatment.

activity to solve a wide range of tasks. However, strategic workers will find
enticement in their self-interest to free-ride and attack in a crowdsourcing
contest dilemma game. Hence, incentive mechanisms are of great importance to
overcome the inefficiency of the socially undesirable equilibrium. Existing
incentive mechanisms are not effective in providing incentives for cooperation
in crowdsourcing competitions due to the following features: heterogeneous
workers compete against each other in a crowdsourcing platform with imperfect
monitoring. In this paper, we take these features into consideration, and
develop a novel game-theoretic design of rating protocols, which integrates
binary rating labels with differential pricing to maximize the requester's
utility, by extorting selfish workers and enforcing cooperation among them. By
quantifying necessary and sufficient conditions for the sustainable social
norm, we formulate the problem of maximizing the revenue of the requester among
all sustainable rating protocols, provide design guidelines for optimal rating
protocols, and design a low-complexity algorithm to select optimal design
parameters which are related to differential punishments and pricing schemes.
Simulation results demonstrate how intrinsic parameters impact on design
parameters, as well as the performance gain of the proposed rating protocol.

it is stripped of aureole when collective efforts are derailed or severely
hindered by elaborate sabotage. A service exchange dilemma arises when
non-cooperation among self-interested users, and zero social welfare is
obtained at myopic equilibrium. Traditional rating protocols are not effective
to overcome the inefficiency of the socially undesirable equilibrium due to
specific features of crowdsourcing: a large number of anonymous users having
asymmetric service requirements, different service capabilities, and
dynamically joining/leaving a crowdsourcing platform with imperfect monitoring.
In this paper, we develop the first game-theoretic design of the two-sided
rating protocol to stimulate cooperation among self-interested users, which
consists of a recommended strategy and a rating update rule. The recommended
strategy recommends a desirable behavior from three predefined plans according
to intrinsic parameters, while the rating update rule involves the update of
ratings of both users, and uses differential punishments that punish users with
different ratings differently. By quantifying necessary and sufficient
conditions for a sustainable social norm, we formulate the problem of designing
an optimal two-sided rating protocol that maximizes the social welfare among
all sustainable protocols, provide design guidelines for optimal two-sided
rating protocols and a low-complexity algorithm to select optimal design
parameters in an alternate manner. Finally, evaluation results show the
validity and effectiveness of our protocol designed for service exchange

Optimization, to invert the Love and quasi-Rayleigh surface-wave speeds,
obtained from dispersion curves, in order to infer the elasticity parameters,
mass densities and layer thickness of the model for which these curves are
generated. For both waves, we use the dispersion relations derived by Dalton et
al. (2017). Numerical results are presented for three angular frequencies, 15
Hz, 60 Hz and 100 Hz, and for two, five and seven modes, respectively.
Comparisons of the model parameters with the values inverted with error-free
input indicate an accurate process. If, however, we introduce a 5% error to the
input, the results become significantly less accurate, which indicates that the
inverse operation, even though stable, is error-sensitive. Correlations between
the inverted elasticity parameters indicate that the layer parameters are more
sensitive to input errors than the halfspace parameters. In agreement with
Dalton et al. (2017), the fundamental mode is mainly sensitive to the layer
parameters whereas higher modes are sensitive to both the layer and halfspace
properties; for the second mode, the results are more accurate for low
frequencies.

nodes generated by a spectral scanning device. The aim is to classify the
nodes, excised during surgery for breast cancer, as normal or metastatic. The
data from one node constitute spectra at 86 wavelengths for each pixel of a
20*20 grid. For the analysis, the spectra are reduced to scores on two factors,
one derived externally from a linear discriminant analysis using spectra taken
manually from known normal and metastatic tissue, and one derived from the node
under investigation to capture variability orthogonal to the external factor.
Then a three-group mixture model (normal, metastatic, non-nodal background)
using multivariate t distributions is fitted to the scores, with external data
being used to specify informative prior distributions for the parameters of the
three distributions. A Markov random field prior imposes smoothness on the
image generated by the model. Finally, the node is classified as metastatic if
any one pixel in this smoothed image is classified as metastatic. The model
parameters were tuned on a training set of nodes, and then the tuned model was
tested on a separate validation set of nodes, achieving satisfactory
sensitivity and specificity. The aim in developing the analysis was to allow
flexibility in the way each node is modelled whilst still using external
information. The Bayesian framework employed is ideal for this.

edge crossings, but only with respect to some local forbidden crossing
configurations. Early research dates back to the 1960s (e.g., Avital and Hanani
1966) for extremal problems on geometric graphs, but is also related to graph
drawing problems where visual clutter by edge crossings should be minimized
(e.g., Huang et al. 2008) that could negatively affect the readability of the
drawing. Different types of forbidden crossing configurations give rise to
different families of nearly-planar graphs.
  Most of the literature focuses on Tur\'an-type problems, which ask for the
maximum number of edges a nearly-planar graph can have. Here, we study this
problem for bipartite topological graphs, considering several types of
nearly-planar graphs, i.e., 1-planar, 2-planar, fan-planar, and RAC graphs. We
prove bounds on the number of edges that are tight up to small additive

emission and continuum modeling, as a function of both mass and environment. We
find that more star forming galaxies are observed at larger clustercentric
distances, while infalling galaxies show evidence for recently enhanced star
forming activity. Main sequence galaxies, defined by their continuum star
formation rates, show different evolutionary behavior based on their mass. At
the low mass end, the galaxies have had their star formation recently quenched,
while more massive galaxies show no significant change. The timescales probed
here favor fast quenching mechanisms, such as ram-pressure stripping. Galaxies
within the green valley, defined similarly, do not show evidence of quenching.
Instead, the low mass galaxies maintain their levels of star forming activity,
while the more massive galaxies have experienced a recent burst.

leverages the difference between a predicted future frame and its ground truth
to detect an abnormal event. To predict a future frame with higher quality for
normal events, other than the commonly used appearance (spatial) constraints on
intensity and gradient, we also introduce a motion (temporal) constraint in
video prediction by enforcing the optical flow between predicted frames and
ground truth frames to be consistent, and this is the first work that
introduces a temporal constraint into the video prediction task. Such spatial
and motion constraints facilitate the future frame prediction for normal
events, and consequently facilitate to identify those abnormal events that do

some publicly available datasets validate the effectiveness of our method in

be forbidden by a $Z_3$ symmetry, which in addition leads to a reduction of the
number of higher dimensional operators. Moreover, a weak scale mass for the

with the diffeomorphism invariance of general relativity one generally
introduces combinations of the metric and matter perturbations which are gauge
invariant up to the considered order in the perturbations. For linear
cosmological perturbations one works with the so-called Bardeen potentials
widely used in this context. However, there exists no common procedure to
construct gauge invariant quantities also for higher order perturbations.
Usually, one has to find new gauge invariant quantities independently for each
order in perturbation theory. With the relational formalism introduced by
Rovelli and further developed by Dittrich and Thiemann, it is in principle
possible to calculate manifestly gauge invariant quantities, that is quantities
that are gauge invariant up to arbitrary order once one has chosen a set of
so-called reference fields, often also called clock fields. This article
contains a review of the relational formalism and its application to canonical
general relativity following the work of Garcia, Pons, Sundermeyer and
Salisbury. As the starting point for our application of this formalism to
cosmological perturbation theory, we also review the Hamiltonian formulation of
the linearized theory for perturbations around FLRW spacetimes. The main aim of
our work will be to identify clock fields in the context of the relational
formalism that can be used to reconstruct quantities like the Bardeen potential
as well as the Mukhanov-Sasaki variable. This requires a careful analysis of
the canonical formulation in the extended ADM-phase space where lapse and shift
are treated as dynamical variables. The actual construction of such observables
and further investigations thereof will be carried out in our companion paper.

parameter of the CIV absorption, which can only be poorly determined at
$\beta_c=1.1\pm 0.6$ from our data. This transmission bias is related to the
bias of CIV absorbers and their host halos through the effective mean optical
depth of the CIV forest, $\bar\tau_c$. Estimating a value $\bar \tau_c(z)
\simeq 0.01$ from previous studies of the CIV equivalent width distribution,
our measurement implies a CIV absorber bias near unity, with a large error due
to uncertainties in both $\beta_c$ and $\bar\tau_c$. This makes it compatible

cross-correlation of DLAs and the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. We discuss the

propagation in this dispersive hyperbolic medium consisting of real dielectric

studied numerically. This packet velocity is very close to the velocity of the

small discrepancy between these two velocities manifests, which is caused by
the non-penetration effect of the evanescent modes. This work reveals that no

continuously modify their solutions, thus coupling them indirectly instead of
directly introducing a coupling term. This maintains the quantum system in a
pure state even after the introduction of thermal effects and obtains not only
a density matrix but also a state vector representation. Further, we
demonstrate that the dynamics of a two-level system can be rewritten as a set
of standard differential equations, resulting in quantum dynamics that includes
thermal relaxation. These equations are equivalent to the optical Bloch
equations at the weak coupling and asymptotic limits, implying that the
dynamics cause thermal effects naturally. Numerical simulations of
ferromagnetic and frustrated systems support this idea. Finally, we use this
method to study thermal effects in quantum annealing, revealing nontrivial
performance improvements for a spin glass model over a certain range of
annealing time. This result may enable us to optimize the annealing time of

that the complex structure of the modes of a periodic plasmonic array and the
nonlinear interaction between the modes through the active medium lead to a new
effect, namely, mode cooperation. Mode cooperation is manifested as the
generation of the modes in an allowed band with a high threshold instead of
modes localized near the band gap with a low threshold. Suppression of lasing

solutions for this system are obtained by using the Hirota bilinear method
whereas the semi-rational solutions are generated by taking the long-wave limit
of a part of exponential functions in the general expression of the N-soliton
solution. Three kinds of semi-rational solutions, namely (1) a hybrid of rogue
waves and periodic line waves, (2) a hybrid of lump and breather solutions, and
(3) a hybrid of lump, breather, and periodic line waves are put forward and
their rather complicated dynamics is revealed.

Relativity and Newtonian gravity via the general function satisfying Newton's
theorem according to which the gravitating sphere acts as a point mass situated
in its center. The quantitative evidence for this link is given via the
correspondence of the current value of the cosmological constant with the value
of the cosmological term in the modified Newtonian gravity to explain the dark
matter in the galaxies. This approach reveals: (a) the nature of dark matter as
gravity's signature, (b) the common nature of dark matter and of cosmological
constant (dark energy), (c) that the dark matter as a consequence of repulsive
gravity increasing with the distance ensures the observed higher
mass-to-luminosity M/L ratio while moving from the scales of galaxies to galaxy
clusters. The galactic halos via non-force-free interaction due to the
repulsive \Lambda-term of gravity determine the features of galactic disks as
is supported by observations. The data of galaxy groups of the Hercules-Bootes
region are also shown to support the \Lambda-gravity nature of the dark matter
i.e. the value of the cosmological constant is derived not from cosmological
data. Among the consequences of such modified General Relativity is the natural
link to AdS/CFT correspondence.

with the observations of cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB), baryon
acoustic oscillation (BAO), and large scale structure of the Universe. However,
the discrepancy in the value of $H_0$ between the local observations and PLANCK
observation of CMB was recently pointed out. One of the way to ease the
discrepancy is to introduce phantom dark energy instead of the cosmological
constant. While, phantom dark energy often suffer from the instabilities. We
will investigate the general solution to overcome the difficulty of phantom
dark energy and construct some particular models which have a phantom crossing
and can be consistent with the observations.

field. To this aim, we first obtain the inflationary observables, including the
scalar spectral index, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, the running of the scalar
spectral index, as well as the non-Gaussianity parameters. Then, we examine the
observational viability of the intermediate inflation within the framework of a
Galileon scenario. Our results show that although the prediction of
intermediate inflation in the standard framework is completely ruled out by the
Planck 2015 observations, it can be put inside the allowed regions of the
Planck 2015 TT,TE,EE+lowP data in the Galileon setting. Moreover, we determine
the parameter space of the Galileon intermediate inflation for which the model
is consistent with the Planck 2015 data. Besides, we derive the consistency
relation in the Galileon scenario, and find that it differs from the standard
inflation. We also estimate the running of the scalar spectral index and find
that it is in well agreement with the 95\% CL constraint of the Planck 2015
results. Finally, we evaluate the local, equilateral, orthogonal, and enfolded
non-Gaussianity parameters, and conclude that not only is the shape of
non-Gaussianity approximately close to the equilateral one, but that it also
satisfies the 68\% CL bound from the Planck 2015 data.

  Robots and Exoskeleton Suits","14 pages, 15 figures",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reconfigurable robots refer to a category of robots that their components
(individual joints and links) can be assembled in multiple configurations and
geometries. Most of existing latching mechanisms are based on physical tools
such as hooks, cages or magnets, which limit the payload capacity. Therefore,
robots re- quire a latching mechanism which can help to reconfigure itself
without sacrificing the payload capability. This paper presents a latching
mechanism based on the flexible screw attaching principle. In which, actuators
are used to move the robot links and joints while connecting them with a
motorized-screw and dis- connecting them by unfastening the screw. The brackets
used in our mechanism configuration helps to hold maximum force up to 5000N.
The LaMMos - Latching Mechanism based on Motorized- screw has been applied to
the DeWaLoP - Developing Water Loss Prevention in-pipe robot. It helps the
robot to shrink its body to crawl into the pipe with minimum diameter, by
recon- figuring the leg positions. And it helps to recover the legs positions
to original status once the robot is inside the pipe. Also, LaMMos add
stiffness to the robot legs by dynamically integrate them to the structure.
Additionally, we present an application of the LaMMos mechanism to exoskeleton
suits, for easing the mo- tors from the joints when carrying heavy weights for
long periods of time. This mechanism offers many interesting opportunities for
robotics research in terms of functionality, pay- load and size.

theory of supersymmetry to study a superspace over time series data for the
detection of hidden general supply and demand equilibrium in the financial
market. We provide a proof of the existence of the general equilibrium point
over 14-extradimensions of the new G-theory compared to M-theory of 11
dimensions model of Edward Witten. We found that the process of coupling
between nonequilibrium and equilibrium spinor fields of expectation ghost
fields in the superspace of time series data induces an infinitely long exact
sequence of cohomology from a short exact sequence of moduli state space model.
If we assume that the financial market is separated into $2$ topological spaces
of supply and demand as the D-brane and anti-D-brane model, then we can use a
cohomology group to compute the stability of the market as a stable point of
the general equilibrium of the interaction between D-branes of the market. We
obtain the result that the general equilibrium will exist if and only if the
14-th-Batalin-Vilkovisky cohomology group with the negative dimensions
underlying major 14 hidden factors influencing the market is zero.

equation. It was originally used for the analysis of elastodynamic plane waves
in laterally invariant media. It has been extended by various authors for
laterally varying media. Other authors derived a similar formalism for other
wave phenomena. This paper starts with a unified formulation of the
matrix-vector wave equation for 3D inhomogeneous, dissipative media. The wave
vector, source vector and operator matrix are specified in the appendices for
acoustic, quantum mechanical, electromagnetic, elastodynamic,
poroelastodynamic, piezoelectric and seismoelectric waves. It is shown that the
operator matrix obeys unified symmetry relations for all these wave phenomena.
Next, unified matrix-vector reciprocity theorems of the convolution and
correlation type are derived, utilising the symmetry properties of the operator
matrix. These theorems formulate mathematical relations between two wave states
in the same spatial domain. A unified wave field representation is obtained by
replacing one of the states in the convolution-type reciprocity theorem by a
Green's state. By replacing both states in the correlation-type reciprocity
theorem by Green's states, a unified representation of the homogeneous Green's
matrix is obtained. Applications of the unified reciprocity theorems and
representations for forward and inverse wave problems are briefly indicated.
