an important tool in studying and computing the relevant Floer homology groups.
These exact triangles relate the invariants of 3-manifolds, obtained by three
different Dehn surgeries on a fixed knot. In this paper, the behavior of
$SU(N)$-instanton Floer homology with respect to Dehn surgery is studied. In
particular, it is shown that there are surgery exact tetragons and pentagons,
respectively, for $SU(3)$- and $SU(4)$-instanton Floer homologies. It is also
conjectured that $SU(N)$-instanton Floer homology in general admits a surgery
exact $(N+1)$-gon. An essential step in the proof is the construction of a
family of asymptotically cylindrical metrics on ALE spaces of type $A_n$. This
family is parametrized by the $(n-2)$-dimensional associahedron and consists of
anti-self-dual metrics with positive scalar curvature. The metrics in the
family also admit a torus symmetry.

appear in the classical theory of gravity. In General Relativity (GR), horizons
have several defining properties. First, there exists a static spherically
symmetric solution to vacuum Einstein equations which possesses a horizon
defined as a null-surface on which the time-like Killing vector becomes null.
Second, in GR, a co-dimension two sphere of minimal area is necessarily a
horizon. On a quantum level, the classical gravitational action is supplemented
by the quantum effective action obtained by integrating out the quantum fields
propagating on a classical background. In this note we consider the case when
the quantum fields are conformal and perform a certain non-perturbative
analysis of the semiclassical equations obtained by varying the complete
gravitational action. We show that, for these equations, both of the above
aspects do not hold. More precisely, we prove that i) a static spherically
symmetric metric that would describe a horizon with a finite Hawking
temperature is, generically, {\it not} a solution; ii) a minimal $2$-sphere is
{\it not} a horizon but a tiny throat of a wormhole. We find certain bounds on
the norm of the Killing vector at the throat and show that it is, while
non-zero, an exponentially small function of the Bekenstein-Hawking (BH)
entropy of the classical black hole. We also find that the possible temperature
of the semiclassical geometry is exponentially small for large black holes.
These findings suggest that a black hole in the classical theory can be viewed
as a certain (singular) limit of the semiclassical wormhole geometry. We
discuss the possible implications of our results.

  This paper discusses a number of examples from the literature-as well as some
entirely new ideas-of natural and social science field studies that could be
piloted, supplemented, replicated, or conducted using YFCC100M data. These
examples illustrate the need for a general new open-source framework for
Multimedia Big Data Field Studies. There is currently a gap between the
separate aspects of what multimedia researchers have shown to be possible with
consumer-produced big data and the follow-through of creating a comprehensive
field study framework that supports scientists across other disciplines.
  To bridge this gap, we must meet several challenges. For example, the
framework must handle unlabeled and noisily labeled data to produce a filtered
dataset for a scientist-who naturally wants it to be both as large and as clean
as possible. This requires an iterative approach that provides access to
statistical summaries and refines the search by constructing new classifiers.

mission suggest a hemispherical power amplitude asymmetry in the cosmic
microwave background, with a correlation length on the order of the size of the
observable Universe. We find that this anomaly can be naturally explained by an
axion-like particle (ALP) cosmic string formed near our visible Universe. The
field variation associated to this cosmic string creates particle density
fluctuations after inflation, which consequently decay into radiation before
the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) era and resulted in the observed power
asymmetry. We find in this scenario that the hemispherical power amplitude
asymmetry is strongly scale dependent: $A(k)\propto {\rm exp}(-kl)/k$.
Admittedly, typical inflation models predict a relic number density of
topological defects of order one per observable Universe and so in our model
the cosmic string must be tuned to have an impact factor of order $1/H_0$.
Interestingly, the constraints based on purely cosmological considerations also
give rise to a Peccei-Quinn scale $F_a$ of order $10^3$ larger then the Hubble
scale of inflation $H_I$. Assuming $H_I\sim 10^{13}$GeV, we then have an ALP
with $F_a\sim 10^{16}$GeV, which coincides with the presumed scale of grand
unification. As we require ALP decays occur before the BBN era, which implies a
relatively heavy mass or strong self-coupling, and considering that the
associated potential should break the shift symmetry softly in order to protect
the system from radiative corrections, we also conclude that the required ALP
potential should be monodromic in nature.

require a spectrum of cosmological abundances which scale inversely with mass,
so that dark-sector states with larger masses have smaller abundances. Thus
far, DDM model-building has primarily relied on non-thermal mechanisms for
abundance generation such as misalignment production, since these mechanisms
give rise to abundances that have this property. By contrast, the simplest

demonstrate that there exist relatively simple modifications of the traditional

that a far broader variety of scaling relations between lifetimes, abundances,

involves two right-handed (RH) neutrinos $\nu_{1R}$ and $\nu_{2R}$ having a
Majorana mass term with mass $M$, which conserves the lepton charge $L$. The RH
neutrino $\nu_{2R}$ has lepton-charge conserving Yukawa couplings $g_{\ell 2}$
to the lepton and Higgs doublet fields, while small lepton-charge breaking
effects are assumed to induce tiny lepton-charge violating Yukawa couplings
$g_{\ell 1}$ for $\nu_{1R}$, $l=e,\mu,\tau$. In this approach the smallness of
neutrino masses is related to the smallness of the Yukawa coupling of
$\nu_{1R}$ and not to the large value of $M$: the RH neutrinos can have masses
in the few GeV to a few TeV range. The Yukawa couplings $|g_{\ell 2}|$ can be
much larger than $|g_{\ell 1}|$, of the order $|g_{\ell 2}| \sim 10^{-4} -
10^{-2}$, leading to interesting low-energy phenomenology. We consider a
specific realisation of this scenario within the Froggatt-Nielsen approach to
fermion masses. In this model the Dirac CP violation phase $\delta$ is
predicted to have approximately one of the values $\delta \simeq \pi/4,\,
3\pi/4$, or $5\pi/4,\, 7\pi/4$, or to lie in a narrow interval around one of

problems for the (third-order in time) Moore-Gibson-Thompson (MGT) equation.
The key to the present investigation is that the MGT equation falls within a
large class of systems with memory, with affine term depending on a parameter.
For this model equation a regularity theory is provided, which is of also
independent interest; it is shown in particular that the effect of boundary
data that are square integrable (in time and space) is the same displayed by
wave equations. Then, a general picture of the (interior) regularity of
solutions corresponding to homogeneous boundary conditions is specifically
derived for the MGT equation in various functional settings. This confirms the
gain of one unity in space regularity for the time derivative of the unknown, a
feature that sets the MGT equation apart from other PDE models for wave
propagation. The adopted perspective and method of proof enables us to attain
as well the (sharp) regularity of boundary traces.

  Decomposition Method and Hierarchical Matrices","25 pages",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper the author introduces a new domain decomposition method for the
solution of discretised integral equation eigenvalue problems. The new domain
decomposition method is motivated by the so-called automated multi-level
substructuring (short AMLS) method. The AMLS method is a domain decomposition
method for the solution of elliptic PDE eigenvalue problems which has been
shown to be very efficient especially when a large number of eigenpairs is
sought. In general the AMLS method is only applicable to these kind of
continuous eigenvalue problems where the corresponding discretisation leads to
an algebraic eigenvalue problem of the form $Kx=\lambda Mx$ where $K,M \in
\mathbb{R}^{N\times N}$ are symmetric sparse matrices. However, the
discretisation of an integral equation eigenvalue problem leads to a discrete
problem where the matrix $K$ is typically dense, since a non-local integral
operator is involved in the equation. In the new method, which is introduced in
this paper, the domain decomposition technique of classical AMLS is generalised
to eigenvalue problems $Kx=\lambda Mx$ where $K,M$ are symmetric and possibly
dense, and which is therefor applicable for the solution of integral equation
eigenvalue problems. To make out of this an efficient eigensolver, the new
domain decomposition method is combined with a recursive approach and with the
concept of hierarchical matrices.

advantage of signal strength to reduce this bias, leading to sharper error
bounds in prediction, coefficient estimation and variable selection. For
prediction and estimation, the bias of the Lasso can be also reduced by taking
a smaller penalty level than what selection consistency requires, but such
smaller penalty level depends on the sparsity of the true coefficient vector.
The sorted L1 penalized estimation (Slope) was proposed for adaptation to such
smaller penalty levels. However, the advantages of concave PLSE and Slope do
not subsume each other. We propose sorted concave penalized estimation to
combine the advantages of concave and sorted penalizations. We prove that
sorted concave penalties adaptively choose the smaller penalty level and at the
same time benefits from signal strength, especially when a significant
proportion of signals are stronger than the corresponding adaptively selected
penalty levels. A local convex approximation, which extends the local linear
and quadratic approximations to sorted concave penalties, is developed to
facilitate the computation of sorted concave PLSE and proven to possess desired
prediction and estimation error bounds. We carry out a unified treatment of
penalty functions in a general optimization setting, including the penalty
levels and concavity of the above mentioned sorted penalties and mixed
penalties motivated by Bayesian considerations. Our analysis of prediction and
estimation errors requires the restricted eigenvalue condition on the design,
not beyond, and provides selection consistency under a required minimum signal
strength condition in addition. Thus, our results also sharpens existing
results on concave PLSE by removing the upper sparse eigenvalue component of
the sparse Riesz condition.

following question: given $n$ agents, each with its own initial opinion that
reflects its core value on a topic, and an opinion dynamics model, what is the
structure of a social network that minimizes {\em polarization} and {\em
disagreement} simultaneously?
  This question is central to recommender systems: should a recommender system
prefer a link suggestion between two online users with similar mindsets in
order to keep disagreement low, or between two users with different opinions in
order to expose each to the other's viewpoint of the world, and decrease
overall levels of polarization? Our contributions include a mathematical
formalization of this question as an optimization problem and an exact,
time-efficient algorithm. We also prove that there always exists a network with
$O(n/\epsilon^2)$ edges that is a $(1+\epsilon)$ approximation to the optimum.
For a fixed graph, we additionally show how to optimize our objective function
over the agents' innate opinions in polynomial time.
  We perform an empirical study of our proposed methods on synthetic and
real-world data that verify their value as mining tools to better understand
the trade-off between of disagreement and polarization. We find that there is a
lot of space to reduce both polarization and disagreement in real-world
networks; for instance, on a Reddit network where users exchange comments on
politics, our methods achieve a $\sim 60\,000$-fold reduction in polarization

left-moving electrons carry a fixed spin-projection that is reversed for
right-moving electrons, and the probability of electrons to transfer through
the nanotube correlates with their helicity. We explain the origin of this
effect and show that it can alternatively be induced by twisting the nanotube.
Our findings suggest that carbon nanotubes hold great potential for
implementing spin filters and may form an ideal platform to study the physical
properties of one-dimensional helical liquids.

approximations. Virtually exact numerical solutions for realistic interactions
can only be obtained for certain special cases such as few-nucleon systems.
Here we extend the reach of exact diagonalization methods to handle model
spaces with dimension exceeding $10^{10}$ on a single compute node. This allows
us to perform no-core shell model (NCSM) calculations for 6Li in model spaces
up to $N_\mathrm{max} = 22$ and to reveal the 4He+d halo structure of this
nucleus. Still, the use of a finite harmonic-oscillator basis implies
truncations in both infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) length scales. These
truncations impose finite-size corrections on observables computed in this
basis. We perform IR extrapolations of energies and radii computed in the NCSM
and with the coupled-cluster method at several fixed UV cutoffs. It is shown
that this strategy enables information gain also from data that is not fully UV
converged. IR extrapolations improve the accuracy of relevant bound-state
observables for a range of UV cutoffs, thus making them profitable tools. We
relate the momentum scale that governs the exponential IR convergence to the
threshold energy for the first open decay channel. Using large-scale NCSM
calculations we numerically verify this small-momentum scale of finite nuclei.

rationals of size poly(n,s,r), with poly(n,s,r) bit complexity, that hits all
n-variate polynomials of degree-r that are the limit of size-s algebraic
circuits. Previously it was known that a random set of this size is a hitting
set, but a construction that is certified to work was only known in EXPSPACE
(or EXPH assuming the generalized Riemann hypothesis). As a corollary we get
that a host of other algebraic problems such as Noether Normalization Lemma,
can also be solved in PSPACE deterministically, where earlier only randomized
algorithms and EXPSPACE algorithms (or EXPH assuming the generalized Riemann

  The proof relies on the new notion of a robust hitting set which is a set of
inputs such that any nonzero polynomial that can be computed by a polynomial
size algebraic circuit, evaluates to a not too small value on at least one

crystals, giving rise to long-range interactions that minimize the free energy
of distorted regions. Particle shape and topology are known to guide this
self-assembly process. However, how chirality of colloidal inclusions affects
these long-range interactions is unclear. Here we study the effects of
distortions caused by chiral springs and helices on the colloidal
self-organization in a nematic liquid crystal using laser tweezers, particle
tracking and optical imaging. We show that chirality of colloidal particles
interacts with the nematic elasticity to predefine chiral or racemic colloidal
superstructures in nematic colloids. These findings are consistent with
numerical modelling based on the minimization of Landau-de Gennes free energy.
Our study uncovers the role of chirality in defining the mesoscopic order of
liquid crystal colloids, suggesting that this feature may be a potential tool
to modulate the global orientated self-organization of these systems.

Vol. 2 Issue No. 4 (2017)",,,"q-fin.GN q-fin.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The definition of deposit substitutes in Philippine tax law fails to consider
the maturity of a debt instrument. This makes it possible for long-term bonds
to be considered as deposit substitutes if they meet the 20-lender rule,
taxable at 20% final tax. However, long-term debt instruments cannot
realistically function as deposit substitutes even if they fall in the hands of
20 or more lenders. First, long-term debt instruments cannot simultaneously
replicate the twin features of capital preservation and liquidity, which are
integral to the nature of a deposit substitute. Second, deposit substitutes are
an integral part of the maturity transformation process (i.e. short-term
borrowing for the purpose of long-term lending) in financial intermediaries,
which means that they should have low borrowing cost, made possible only by
having short-term maturity. To prove these propositions, this paper situates
the function of deposit substitutes within the context of shadow banking, where
said instruments originated and are generally used. To show the incompatibility
between a deposit substitute and a long-term debt instrument, the paper applies
the fundamental theory of bond values to 10-year zero-coupon treasury notes
called 'PEACe Bonds' in Banco De Oro, et al. vs. Republic (2015 and 2016). The
paper recommends that deposit substitutes should be limited to debt instruments
with maturity of not more than 1 year.

composition of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) becomes gradually heavier
with increasing energy. Although gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been promising
sources of UHECRs, it is still unclear whether they can account for the Auger
results because of their unknown nuclear composition of ejected UHECRs. In this
work, we revisit the possibility that low-luminosity GRBs (LL GRBs) act as the
sources of UHECR nuclei, and give new predictions based on the intrajet nuclear
composition models considering progenitor dependencies. We find that the
nuclear component in the jet can be divided into two groups according to the
mass fraction of silicon nuclei, Si-free and Si-rich. Motivated by the
connection between LL GRBs and transrelativistic supernovae, we also consider
the hypernova ejecta composition. Then, we discuss the survivability of UHECR
nuclei in the jet base and internal shocks of the jets, and show that it is
easier for nuclei to survive for typical LL GRBs. Finally, we numerically
propagate UHECR nuclei ejected from LL GRBs with different composition models
and compare the resulting spectra and composition to Auger data. Our results
show that both the Si-rich progenitor and hypernova ejecta models match the
Auger data well, while the Si-free progenitor models have more difficulty in
fitting the spectrum. We argue that our model is consistent with the newly
reported cross correlation between the UHECRs and starburst galaxies, since
both LL GRBs and hypernovae are expected to be tracers of the star-formation
activity. LL GRBs have also been suggested as the dominant origin of IceCube
neutrinos in the PeV range, and the LL GRB origin of UHECRs can be critically
tested by near-future multimessenger observations.

the borrowed share of stock. This only makes sense if the short seller
anticipates a downward trend in share price. The short seller incurs a gain if
share price decreases because the cost of replacing the borrowed share falls
below the selling price. The reverse is true in an ordinary sale, where a
person owning a share of stock incurs a loss if price decreases because the
selling price falls below the basis or acquisition cost. Therefore, when a
taxpayer simultaneously owns a share of stock and short sells an identical
stock, any gain in an ordinary sale of the owned stock is offset by a
corresponding loss in the short sale of the borrowed identical stock, vice
versa. This offsetting effect, in turn, creates an unexpected tax deferral
opportunity abused in other jurisdictions and which remains unregulated in the

average treatment effects (CATE) characterized by a high-dimensional parameter
in both homogeneous cross-sectional and unit-heterogeneous dynamic panel data
settings. In our leading example, we model CATE by interacting the base
treatment variable with explanatory variables. The first step of our procedure
is orthogonalization, where we partial out the controls and unit effects from
the outcome and the base treatment and take the cross-fitted residuals. This
step uses a novel generic cross-fitting method we design for weakly dependent
time series and panel data. This method ""leaves out the neighbors"" when fitting
nuisance components, and we theoretically power it by using Strassen's
coupling. As a result, we can rely on any modern machine learning method in the
first step, provided it learns the residuals well enough. Second, we construct
an orthogonal (or residual) learner of CATE -- the Lasso CATE -- that regresses
the outcome residual on the vector of interactions of the residualized
treatment with explanatory variables. If the complexity of CATE function is
simpler than that of the first-stage regression, the orthogonal learner
converges faster than the single-stage regression-based learner. Third, we
perform simultaneous inference on parameters of the CATE function using
debiasing. We also can use ordinary least squares in the last two steps when
CATE is low-dimensional. In heterogeneous panel data settings, we model the
unobserved unit heterogeneity as a weakly sparse deviation from Mundlak
(1978)'s model of correlated unit effects as a linear function of
time-invariant covariates and make use of L1-penalization to estimate these
models. We demonstrate our methods by estimating price elasticities of

have found an extremely simple pattern, yet far more non-trivial than one might
naturally expect: the all-loop Mondrian diagrammatics. By further simplifying
and rephrasing the key relation of positivity in the amplituhedron setting,
remarkably, we find a completeness relation unifying all diagrams of the
Mondrian types for the 4-particle integrand of planar N=4 SYM to all loop
orders, each of which can be mapped to a simple product following a few plain
rules designed for this relation. The explicit examples we investigate span
from 3-loop to 7-loop order, and based on them, we classify the basic patterns
of Mondrian diagrams into four types: the ladder, cross, brick-wall and spiral
patterns. Interestingly, for some special combinations of ordered subspaces (a
concept defined in the previous work), we find failed exceptions of the
completeness relation which are called ""anomalies"", nevertheless, they
substantially give hints on the all-loop recursive proof of this relation.
These investigations are closely related to the combinatoric knowledge of
separable permutations and Schroeder numbers, and go even further from a
diagrammatic perspective. For physical relevance, we need to further consider
dual conformal invariance for two basic diagrammatic patterns to correct the
numerator for a local integrand involving one or both of such patterns, while
the denominator encoding its pole structure and also the sign factor, are
already fixed by rules of the completeness relation. With this extra treatment
to ensure the integrals are dual conformally invariant, each Mondrian diagram
can be exactly translated to its corresponding physical loop integrand after
being summed over all ordered subspaces that admit it.

theory of gravity, in which torsion is coupled to spin of fermions, this
relation in a coordinate frame reduces to a commutation relation of
noncommutative momentum space, $[p_i,p_j]=i\epsilon_{ijk}Up^3 p_k$, where $U$
is a constant on the order of the squared inverse of the Planck mass. We
propose that this relation replaces the integration in the momentum space in
Feynman diagrams with the summation over the discrete momentum eigenvalues. We
derive a prescription for this summation that agrees with convergent integrals:
\[ \int\frac{d^4p}{(p^2+\Delta)^s}\rightarrow 4\pi U^{s-2}\sum_{l=1}^\infty
\int_0^{\pi/2} d\phi \frac{\sin^4\phi\,n^{s-3}}{[\sin\phi+U\Delta n]^s}, \]
where $n=\sqrt{l(l+1)}$ and $\Delta$ does not depend on $p$. We show that this
prescription regularizes ultraviolet-divergent integrals in loop diagrams. We
extend this prescription to tensor integrals. We derive a finite,
gauge-invariant vacuum polarization tensor and a finite running coupling.
Including loops from all charged fermions, we find a finite value for the bare
electric charge of an electron: $\approx -1.22\,e$. This torsional
regularization may therefore provide a realistic, physical mechanism for
eliminating infinities in quantum field theory and making renormalization
finite.

scenario that can violate non-Gaussianity consistency relation with the
Bunch-Davies vacuum state and generate large local non-Gaussianity. However, it
is also known that the non-attractor inflation by itself is incomplete and
should be followed by a phase of slow-roll attractor. Moreover, there is a
transition process between these two phases. In the past literature, this
transition was approximated as instant and the evolution of non-Gaussianity in
this phase was not fully studied. In this paper, we follow the detailed
evolution of the non-Gaussianity through the transition phase into the
slow-roll attractor phase, considering different types of transition. We find
that the transition process has important effect on the size of the local
non-Gaussianity. We first compute the net contribution of the non-Gaussianities
at the end of inflation in canonical non-attractor models. If the curvature
perturbations keep evolving during the transition - such as in the case of
smooth transition or some sharp transition scenarios - the $\mathcal{O}(1)$
local non-Gaussianity generated in the non-attractor phase can be completely
erased by the subsequent evolution, although the consistency relation remains
violated. In extremal cases of sharp transition where the super-horizon modes
freeze immediately right after the end of the non-attractor phase, the original
non-attractor result can be recovered. We also study models with non-canonical
kinetic terms, and find that the transition can typically contribute a
suppression factor in the squeezed bispectrum, but the final local
non-Gaussianity can still be made parametrically large.

overcome the drawback, we propose a scalable and efficient method, named
Parallel Active Subspace Decomposition (PASD), which divides the unfolding
along each mode of the tensor into a columnwise orthonormal matrix (active
subspace) and another small-size matrix in parallel. Such a transformation
leads to a nonconvex optimization problem in which the scale of nulcear norm
minimization is generally much smaller than that in the original problem.
Furthermore, we introduce an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)
method to solve the reformulated problem and provide rigorous analyses for its
convergence and suboptimality. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world
data show that our algorithm is more accurate than the state-of-the-art

that the resonant three--wave coupling is substantial among ion cyclotron and

populations shows that the ion cyclotron component experiences a transition
from weak to strong wave turbulence going from large to small scales, while the
whistler fluctuations display a weak wave turbulence character for all scales.
This non-trivial coexistence of the two regimes with the two populations of
waves gives rise to anomalous anisotropy and scaling properties. The weak and
strong wave turbulence components can be distinguished rather efficiently using
spatio-temporal Fourier transforms. The analysis shows that while resonant
triadic interactions survive the highly non-linear bath of ion cyclotron
fluctuations at large scales for which the degree of non-linearity is low for
both populations of waves, whistler waves tend to be killed by the non-linear
cross-coupling at smaller scales where the ion cyclotron component is in the
strong wave turbulent regime. Such situation may have far-reaching implications
for the physics of magnetized turbulence in many astrophysical and space
plasmas where different waves coexist and compete to transfer non-linearly
energy across scales.

entropy from the static to dynamical case. We show that this method currently

This inequality, while not maximin provable, is much weaker than many of the
inequalities satisfied by the RT formula and should therefore be easier to
prove. If it is valid, then there is strong evidence that holographic
entanglement entropy plays a role in general spacetimes including those that
arise in cosmology. Our new inequality is obtained by the assumption that the

entropies of classical probability distributions. This is a property that the

by forward scattering in the time-domain and contrast its behavior against the
standard isotropic BCS case for both s- and d-wave symmetries. An analysis of
the electron's dynamics in the pump-driven non-equilibrium state reveals that
the superconducting order in the forward-focused case is robust and persistent
against the pump-induced perturbations. The superconducting order parameter
also exhibits a non-uniform melting in momentum space. We show that this
behavior is in sharp contrast to the isotropic interaction case and propose
that time-resolved approaches are a potentially powerful tool to differentiate
the nature of the dominant coupling in correlated materials.

cubic couplings come in two types: lower-derivative non-abelian vertices, and
higher-derivative abelian vertices made out of gauge-invariant curvature
tensors. We find that the abelian couplings between massless higher spins lead
to an asymptotic time advance for certain choices of polarizations, indicating
that these couplings should be absent unless new states come in at the scale
suppressing the derivatives in these couplings. A subset of non-abelian cubic
couplings are consistent with eikonal positivity, but are ruled out by
consistency of the four-particle amplitude away from the eikonal limit. The
eikonal constraints are therefore complementary to the four-particle test,
ruling out even trivial cubic curvature couplings in any theory with a finite

prominently in many extensions of the Standard Model. Such scalars are often
taken to have Higgs-like couplings to SM fermions in order to evade stringent
flavor bounds, e.g. by assuming Minimal Flavor Violation (MFV), which leads to
a rather characteristic phenomenology. Here we describe an alternative
approach, based on an effective field theory framework for a new scalar that
dominantly couples to one specific SM fermion mass eigenstate. A simple flavor
hypothesis ensures adequate suppression of new flavor changing neutral
currents. We consider radiatively generated flavor changing neutral currents
and scalar potential terms in such theories, demonstrating that they are often
suppressed by small Yukawa couplings, and also describe the role of $CP$
symmetry. We further demonstrate that such scalars can have masses that are
significantly below the electroweak scale while still being natural, provided
they are sufficiently weakly coupled to ordinary matter. In comparison to other
flavor scenarios, our framework is rather versatile since a single (or a few)
desired scalar couplings may be investigated in isolation. We illustrate this
by discussing in detail the examples of an up-specific scalar mediator to dark
matter and a muon-specific scalar that may address the $\sim 3 \sigma$ muon
anomalous magnetic moment discrepancy.

while slightly reducing the feature increase the overall reflectivity thus the
detectable flux of a planet. The depth of the IR ozone feature contributes
substantially to the opacity at lower oxygen concentrations especially for the

the thermal conductivity of silicene originates from the in-plane acoustic
branches, which is about 70\% at room temperature and this contribution becomes
larger by considering vacancy defects. Our results indicate that while the
thermal conductivity of silicene is significantly suppressed by the vacancy
defects, the effect of isotopes on the phononic transport is small. Our
calculations demonstrate that by removing only one of every 400 silicon atoms,

between the two domains all tended to go in one direction, as concepts from
classical optics were incorporated into quantum theory's early development. But
it's becoming increasingly clear that a significant quantum presence exists in
classical territory-and, in particular, that the quintessential quantum
attribute, entanglement, can be seen, studied and exploited in classical
optics. This blurring of the classical-quantum boundary has opened up a
potential new direction for frontier work in optics.

freshness demands on the requested content. The performance of cache
replacement policies that are agnostic to these demands is likely to be
sub-optimal. Motivated by this concern, in this paper, we study caching
policies under a request arrival process which incorporates user freshness
demands. We consider the performance metric to be the steady-state cache hit
probability. We first provide a universal upper bound on the performance of any
caching policy. We then analytically obtain the content-wise hit-rates for the
Least Popular (LP) policy and provide sufficient conditions for the asymptotic
optimality of cache performance under this policy. Next, we obtain an accurate
approximation for the LRU hit-rates in the regime of large content population.
To this end, we map the characteristic time of a content in the LRU policy to
the classical Coupon Collector's Problem and show that it sharply concentrates
around its mean. Further, we develop modified versions of these policies which
eject cache redundancies present in the form of stale contents. Finally, we
propose a new policy which outperforms the above policies by explicitly using
freshness specifications of user requests to prioritize among the cached
contents. We corroborate our analytical insights with extensive simulations.

underlying data manifold when inferring data labels on the target domain. In
comparison with a baseline DA method which only cares about data distribution
alignment between source and target, we derive three different DA models,
namely CDDA, GA-DA, and DGA-DA, to highlight the contribution of Close yet

distributed (IID) assumption by allowing different training and testing input
distributions. Unfortunately, common methods for addressing covariate shift by
trying to remove the bias between training and testing distributions using
importance weighting often provide poor performance guarantees in theory and
unreliable predictions with high variance in practice. Recently developed
methods that construct a predictor that is inherently robust to the
difficulties of learning under covariate shift are restricted to minimizing
logloss and can be too conservative when faced with high-dimensional learning
tasks. We address these limitations in two ways: by robustly minimizing various
loss functions, including non-convex ones, under the testing distribution; and
by separately shaping the influence of covariate shift according to different
feature-based views of the relationship between input variables and example
labels. These generalizations make robust covariate shift prediction applicable
to more task scenarios. We demonstrate the benefits on classification under
covariate shift tasks.

investigations proposed that the logatropic and the polytropic equations of

filamentary structures. Here, we aim to compare the effects of these softer
non-isothermal equation of states with their isothermal counterpart on the
global gravitational instability of a filamentary molecular cloud. By
incorporating the ambipolar diffusion, we use the non-ideal
magnetohydrodynamics framework for a filament that is threaded by a uniform
axial magnetic field. We perturb the fluid and obtain the dispersion relation
both for the logatropic and polytropic equations of state by taking the effects
of magnetic field and ambipolar diffusion into account. Our results suggest
that, in absence of the magnetic field, a softer equation of state makes the
system more prone to gravitational instability. We also observed that a
moderate magnetic field is able to enhance the stability of the filament in a
way that is sensitive to the equation of state in general. However, when the
magnetic field is strong, this effect is suppressed and all the equations of
state have almost the same stability properties. Moreover, we find that for all
the considered equations of state, the ambipolar diffusion has destabilizing
effects on the filament.

applying to massive fields, our theory allows us to cover metrics with slow

systems of coupled wave and Klein-Gordon equations. It is based on a spacetime
foliation defined by merging together asymptotically Euclidean hypersurfaces
(covering spacelike infinity) and asymptotically hyperboloidal hypersurfaces
(covering timelike infinity). A transition domain (reaching null infinity)
limited by two asymptotic light cones is introduced in order to realize this
merging. On the one hand, we exhibit a boost-rotation hierarchy property (as we
call it) which is associated with Minkowski's Killing fields and is enjoyed by
commutators of curved wave operators and, on the other hand, we exhibit a
metric hierarchy property (as we call it) enjoyed by components of Einstein's

novel integral and pointwise estimates which lead us to almost sharp decay
properties (at timelike, null, and spacelike infinity) and, on the other hand,

solutions in timelike and in spacelike directions. New Sobolev inequalities for
Euclidian-hyperboloidal foliations involving the Killing fields of Minkowski
spacetime (but not the scaling field), as well as pointwise bounds for wave and
Klein-Gordon equations on curved spacetimes are established. Our bootstrap
argument involves a hierarchy of (almost sharp) energy and pointwise bounds and
distinguishes between low- and high-order derivatives of the solutions. We
apply this method to the Einstein equations when the matter model is a massive

released in the wind during the W-R phase, and condenses into dust grains that
are seen around W-R stars. The dust grains survive passage through the reverse
shock and the low density shocked wind, reach the dense shell swept-up by the
bubble, detach from the decelerated wind and are injected into the shell. Some
portions of this shell subsequently collapses to form the dense cores that give
rise to solar-type systems. The subsequent aspherical supernova does not inject
appreciable amounts of $^{60}$Fe into the proto-solar-system, thus accounting
for the observed low abundance of $^{60}$Fe. We discuss the details of various

dimensions should increase as the amount of data increases. However, if corpus
size grow in topics which are not specific to the domain of interest, signal to
noise ratio may weaken. Here we set to examine and distinguish these
alternative hypothesis. To investigate the effect of corpus specificity and
size in word-embeddings we study two ways for progressive elimination of
documents: the elimination of random documents vs. the elimination of documents
unrelated to a specific task. We show that Word2vec can take advantage of all
the documents, obtaining its best performance when it is trained with the whole
corpus. On the contrary, the specialization (removal of out-of-domain
documents) of the training corpus, accompanied by a decrease of dimensionality,
can increase LSA word-representation quality while speeding up the processing
time. Furthermore, we show that the specialization without the decrease in LSA
dimensionality can produce a strong performance reduction in specific tasks.
From a cognitive-modeling point of view, we point out that LSA's word-knowledge

$G$ with compact isotropy acts on a discrete locally finite graph $E$ with no

degrees over ~40,000 years, and its eccentricity varies by only ~0.05 over
100,000 years. Nonetheless, these small variations influence Earth's ice ages.
For exoplanets, however, variations can be significantly larger. Previous
studies of the habitability of moonless Earth-like exoplanets have found that
high obliquities, high eccentricities, and dynamical variations can extend the
outer edge of the habitable zone by preventing runaway glaciation (snowball
states). We expand upon these studies by exploring the orbital dynamics with a
semi-analytic model that allows us to map broad regions of parameter space. We
find that in general, the largest drivers of obliquity variations are secular
spin-orbit resonances. We show how the obliquity varies in several test cases,
including Kepler-62 f, across a wide range of orbital and spin parameters.
These obliquity variations, alongside orbital variations, will have a dramatic
impact on the climates of such planets.

from a Virtual-Coordinate (VC) system representing the distance to a small set

low-rank matrix completion, to recover geometric properties of a network with

a combination of geodesic recovery concepts and low-rank matrix completion,
generalized to the case of hop-distances in graphs. Distortion evaluated using
the change of distance among node pairs shows that even with up to 40% to 60%
of random coordinates missing, accurate TPMs can be obtained. TPM generation
can now also be based on different context appropriate VC systems or
measurements as long as they characterize each node with distances to a small
set of random nodes (instead of a global set of anchors). The proposed method
is a significant generalization that allows the topology to be extracted from a
random set of graph geodesics, making it applicable in contexts such as social
networks where VC generation may not be possible.

significant performance as well as economic implications. For example, in our
large-scale empirical study of 107 different workloads on three popular big
data systems, we found that a wrong choice can lead to a 20 times slowdown or
an increase in cost by 10 times.
  Bayesian optimization is a technique for optimizing expensive (black-box)
functions. Previous attempts have only used instance-level information (such as
# of cores, memory size) which is not sufficient to represent the search space.
In this work, we discover that this may lead to the fragility problem---either
incurs high search cost or finds only the sub-optimal solution. The central
insight of this paper is to use low-level performance information to augment
the process of Bayesian Optimization. Our novel low-level augmented Bayesian
Optimization is rarely worse than current practices and often performs much
better (in 46 of 107 cases). Further, it significantly reduces the search cost
in nearly half of our case studies.
  Based on this work, we conclude that it is often insufficient to use
general-purpose off-the-shelf methods for configuring cloud instances without
augmenting those methods with essential systems knowledge such as CPU
utilization, working memory size and I/O wait time.

momentum (OAM) and a chiral molecule remains unanswered. So far, such an
interaction has not been observed experimentally. Here we present a T-matrix
method to study the interaction between optical OAM and the chiral molecule in
a cluster of nanoparticles. We find that strong interaction between the chiral
molecule and OAM can be induced by the excitation of plasmon resonances. An
experimental scheme to observe such an interaction has been proposed.
Furthermore, we have found that the signal of the OAM dichroism can be either
positive or negative, depending on the spatial positions of nanocomposites in
the cross-sections of OAM beams. The cancellation between positive and negative
signals in the spatial average can explain why the interaction has not been
observed in former experiments.

achieve beamforming and multiplexing gains in multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) systems. State-of-the-art limited feedback schemes require feedback
overhead that scales linearly with the number of BS antennas, which is
prohibitive for $5$G massive MIMO. This work proposes novel limited feedback
algorithms that lift this burden by exploiting the inherent sparsity in double
directional (DD) MIMO channel representation using overcomplete dictionaries.
These dictionaries are associated with angle of arrival (AoA) and angle of
departure (AoD) that specifically account for antenna directivity patterns at
both ends of the link. The proposed algorithms achieve satisfactory channel
estimation accuracy using a small number of feedback bits, even when the number
of transmit antennas at the BS is large -- making them ideal for $5$G massive
MIMO. Judicious simulations reveal that they outperform a number of popular
feedback schemes, and underscore the importance of using angle dictionaries
matching the given antenna directivity patterns, as opposed to uniform
dictionaries. The proposed algorithms are lightweight in terms of computation,
especially on the user equipment side, making them ideal for actual deployment
in $5$G systems.

and their dissociation mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we
systematically investigate these mechanisms using dispersion-inclusive density
functional theory, in combination with molecular dynamics simulations. We find
that <c + a> dislocations form more readily on the pyramidal I plane than on
the pyramidal II plane in Mg. The addition of Y atoms in Mg facilitates the
dissociation of <c + a> dislocations on pyramidal II, leading to the easier
formation of the pyramidal II than pyramidal I in Mg-Y alloy. Importantly, in
pyramidal II slip plane, a flat potential-energy surface (PES) exists around
the position of stable stacking fault energy (SFE), which allows cooperative
movement of atoms within the slip plane. Alloying Mg with Y atoms increases the
range of the PES, and ultimately promotes different sliding pathways in the
Mg-Y alloy. These findings are consistent with experimentally observed
activation of the pyramidal II <c + a> slip system in Mg-Y alloys, and provide
important insight into the relationship between dislocation structure and
macroscopic enhancement of plasticity.

quantitative scalar evaluation metrics such as sensitivity and specificity can
often be misleading depending on the requirements of the application.
Evaluation metrics must ultimately reflect the needs of users yet be
sufficiently sensitive to guide algorithm development. Feedback from critical
care clinicians who use automated event detection software in clinical
applications has been overwhelmingly emphatic that a low false alarm rate,
typically measured in units of the number of errors per 24 hours, is the single
most important criterion for user acceptance. Though using a single metric is
not often as insightful as examining performance over a range of operating
conditions, there is a need for a single scalar figure of merit. In this paper,
we discuss the deficiencies of existing metrics for a seizure detection task
and propose several new metrics that offer a more balanced view of performance.
We demonstrate these metrics on a seizure detection task based on the TUH EEG
Corpus. We show that two promising metrics are a measure based on a concept
borrowed from the spoken term detection literature, Actual Term-Weighted Value
(ATWV), and a new metric, Time-Aligned Event Scoring (TAES), that accounts for
the temporal alignment of the hypothesis to the reference annotation. We also
demonstrate that state of the art technology based on deep learning, though
impressive in its performance, still needs significant improvement before it
meets very strict user acceptance criteria.

objective in a cloud/distributed computing cluster. Users may have diverse

mean that only a subset of servers may be usable by a given user. In platforms
with such heterogeneity, we identify important limitations in existing
multi-resource fair allocation mechanisms, notably Dominant Resource Fairness
(DRF) and its follow-up work. To overcome such limitations, we propose a new
server-based approach; each server allocates resources by maximizing a
per-server utility function. We propose a specific class of utility functions
which, when appropriately parameterized, adjusts the trade-off between
efficiency and fairness, and captures a variety of fairness measures (such as
our recently proposed Per-Server Dominant Share Fairness). We establish
conditions for the proposed mechanism to satisfy certain properties that are
generally deemed desirable, e.g., envy-freeness, sharing incentive, bottleneck
fairness, and Pareto optimality. To implement our resource allocation
mechanism, we develop an iterative algorithm which is shown to be globally
convergent. Finally, we show how the proposed mechanism could be implemented in
a distributed fashion. We carry out extensive trace-driven simulations to show
the enhanced performance of our proposed mechanism over the existing ones.

value representation for quantum dynamical simulations of liquid water (and
heavy water) under ambient conditions based on an ab initio based, flexible,

stretching bands, and the double-peak in the stretching band in the
experimental isotropic Raman spectrum. In contrast, quantum dynamical effects
are important but less decisive in the anisotropic Raman spectrum. By
selectively freezing either the intramolecular O-H stretching or H-O-H bending
mode, we demonstrate that the peak in the intermediate region (2000-2400 cm-1)
of the isotropic Raman spectrum arises from the interplay of the stretching and

combining a fast multipole method (FMM) based Poisson solver and a time
integrator using a hierarchical Hamiltonian splitting (HHS) technique. We test
our implementation for collision-less systems using several problems in
galactic dynamics. As a result of the momentum conserving nature of these two
key components, the new $N$-body scheme is also momentum conserving. Moreover,
we can fully utilize the $\mathcal O(\textit N)$ complexity of FMM with the

momentum conservation and energy conservation substantially. The new scheme
will be suitable for many applications in galactic dynamics and structure

Deuteron-nucleus scattering is described by the continuum-discretized
coupled-channels method incorporating the microscopic proton-nucleus and
neutron-nucleus potentials. The ASF is found to affect proton total reaction
cross sections for a 12C target below 200 MeV by about 10%. Effect of the ASF
on total reaction cross sections is negligibly small if a target nucleus is
heavy or scattering energy is above 200 MeV; elastic cross sections are hardly
affected by the ASF for all the reaction systems considered. Below 65 MeV,
still the BR localization works quite well. However, at energies below about 50
MeV, the LDA becomes less accurate for evaluating elastic cross sections at
backward angles. This is the case also for the total reaction cross sections of

longer than the relaxation time $\tau_0$ of the polymer. Towards an
understanding of conditions that would satisfy this criterion, we have

conformations of a polyelectrolyte chain (which were artificially generated
with a flow field) on the kinetics of its translocation across a nanopore under
the action of an externally applied transmembrane voltage $V$ (in the absence
of the initial flow field). Stretched (out-of-equilibrium) polyelectrolyte
chain conformations are deliberately and systematically generated and used as
initial conformations in translocation simulations. Independent simulations are
performed to study the relaxation behavior of these stretched chains and a
comparison is made between the relaxation timescale and the mean translocation
time ($\langle \tau \rangle$). For such artificially stretched initial states,
$\langle \tau \rangle/N_K < \tau_0$, demonstrating the inapplicability of the

magnetic activity drops considerably from the normal activity level for several
decades. Many possible theories have been proposed to explain the origin of
these minima. However, how the Sun managed to recover from such inactive phases
every time is even more enigmatic. The Babcock--Leighton type dynamos, which
are successful in explaining many features of the solar cycle remarkably well,
are not expected to operate during grand minima due to the lack of a sufficient
number of sunspots. In this Letter, we explore the question of how the Sun
could recover from grand minima through the Babcock--Leighton dynamo. In our
three-dimensional dynamo model, grand minima are produced spontaneously as a
result of random variations in the tilt angle of emerging active regions. We
find that the Babcock-Leighton process can still operate during grand minima
with only a minimal number of sunspots and that the model can emerge from such
phases without the need for an additional generation mechanism for the poloidal
field. The essential ingredient in our model is a downward magnetic pumping
which inhibits the diffusion of the magnetic flux across the solar surface.

this sparsity in order to reduce computational costs. A class of greedy
compressed sensing algorithms use least squares minimization to approximate PC

design of experiments (ODE). Our work focuses on selecting an experimental
design that improves the accuracy of sparse PC approximations for a fixed
computational budget. We propose DSP, a novel sequential design, greedy

experimental design according to a set of the basis polynomials deemed
important by the magnitude of their coefficients, at each iteration. Our
algorithm incorporates topics from ODE to estimate the PC coefficients. A
variety of numerical simulations are performed on three physical models and
manufactured sparse PC expansions to provide a comparative study between our
proposed algorithm and other non-adaptive methods. Further, we examine the
importance of sampling by comparing different strategies in terms of their
ability to generate a candidate pool from which an optimal experimental design
is chosen. It is demonstrated that the most accurate PC coefficient

design-adaptive greedy algorithm and the use of a studied importance sampling
strategy. We provide theoretical and numerical results which show that using an

systems with imperfect eavesdropper channel state information (ECSI). For
efficient energy transfer and information relaying, a novel two-phase protocol
is proposed, in which the relay operates in full-duplex (FD) mode to achieve
simultaneous wireless power and information transmission. Compared with those
existing protocols, the proposed design possesses two main advantages: 1) it
fully exploits the available hardware resource (antenna element) of relay and
can offer higher secrecy rate; 2) it enables self-energy recycling (S-ER) at
relay, in which the loopback interference (LI) generated by FD operation is
harvested and reused for information relaying. To maximize the worst-case
secrecy rate (WCSR) through jointly designing the source and relay beamformers
coupled with the power allocation ratio, an optimization problem is formulated.
This formulated problem is proved to be non-convex and the challenge to solve
it is how to concurrently solve out the beamformers and the power allocation
ratio. To cope with this difficulty, an alternative approach is proposed by
converting the original problem into three subproblems. By solving these
subproblems iteratively, the closed form solutions of robust beamformers and
power allocation ratio for the original problem are achieved. Simulations are
done and results reveal that the proposed S-ER based secure transmission scheme
outperforms the traditional time-switching based relaying (TSR) scheme at a
maximum WCSR gain of 80%.Results also demonstrate that the WCSR performance of
the scheme reusing idle antennas for information reception is much better than
that of schemes exploiting only one receive antenna.

dispersed in small concentrations in the main membrane phase, including
proteins, sugars, and lipids of varying geometrical properties. Most of these
components do not bind the cargo. Here, we show that such `inert' components
can be crucial for precise control of cross-membrane trafficking. Using a
statistical mechanics model and molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate
that the presence of inert membrane components of small isotropic curvatures
dramatically influences cargo endocytosis, even if the total spontaneous
curvature of such a membrane remains unchanged. Curved lipids, such as
cholesterol, as well as asymmetrically included proteins and tethered sugars
can hence all be actively participating in controlling membrane trafficking of
nanoscopic cargo. We find that even a low-level expression of curved inert
membrane components can determine the membrane selectivity towards the cargo
size, and can be used to selectively target membranes of certain compositions.
Our results suggest a robust and general way to control cargo trafficking by
adjusting the membrane composition without needing to alter the concentration
of receptors nor the average membrane curvature. This study indicates that
cells can prepare for any trafficking event by incorporating curved inert
components in either of the membrane leaflets.

This trigonal YH3 has very clean electronic structure near Fermi level and its
nodal lines locate very closely to the Fermi energy, which makes it a perfect
system for model analysis. Symmetry analysis shows that the nodal ring in this
compound is protected by the glide-plane symmetry, where the band inversion of
|Y+,dxz> and |H1-,s> orbits at Gamma point is responsible for the formation of
the nodal lines. When SOC is included, the line nodes are prohibited by the
glide-plane symmetry, and a small gap (~5 meV) appears, which leads YH3 to be a
strong topological insulator with Z2 indices (1,000). Thus the glide-plane
symmetry plays an opposite role in the formation of the nodal lines in cases
without and with SOC. As the SOC-induced gap is so small that can be neglected,
this P-3c1 YH3 may be a good candidate for experimental explorations on the
fundamental physics of topological node-line semimetals. We find the surface

paper, we explore an alternative scenario assuming that the pulsar responsible

studied numerically with several different sets of parameters. Two types of
behavior are observed, depending on the value of the critical number $R$, which
is a function of the grain inertia, the magnetic susceptibility of the material
and of the strength of rotation braking. If $R\leq10$, the grain ends up in a
static state and perfectly aligned with the magnetic field, after a few braking
times. If not, it goes on precessing and nutating about the field vector for a
much longer time. Usual parameters are such that the first situation can hardly
be observed. Fortunately, in the second and more likely situation, there
remains a persistent partial alignment which is far from negligible, although
it decreases as the field decreases and as $R$ increases. The solution of the
complete equations of motion of grains in a field helps understanding the
details of this behavior. One particular case of an ellipsoidal forsterite
silicate grain is studied in detail and shown to polarize light in agreement
with astronomical measurements of absolute polarization in the infrared.
Phonons are shown to contribute to the progressive flattening of extinction and
polarization towards long wavelengths. The measured dielectric properties of
forsterite qualitatively fit the Serkowski peak in the visible.

powerful winds in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that are distinct from
relativistic jets, likely launched from accretion disks and interacting
strongly with the gas of their host galaxies. During the interaction, strong
shocks are expected to form that can accelerate non-thermal particles to high
energies. Such winds have been suggested to be responsible for a large fraction
of the observed extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGB) in the GeV-TeV range
and the diffuse neutrino background in the PeV range, via the decay of neutral
and charged pions generated in inelastic $pp$ collisions between protons
accelerated by the forward shock and the ambient gas. However, previous studies
did not properly account for processes such as adiabatic losses that may reduce
the gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes significantly. We evaluate the production of
gamma-rays and neutrinos by AGN-driven winds in some detail by modeling their
hydrodynamic and thermal evolution, including the effects of their
two-temperature structure. We find that they can only account for less than
$\sim 30$% of the EGB flux, as otherwise the model would violate the
independent upper limit derived from the diffuse isotropic gamma-ray
background. If the neutrino spectral index is steep with $\Gamma\gtrsim 2.2$, a
severe tension with the isotropic gamma-ray background would arise as long as
the winds contribute more than $20$% of the IceCube neutrino flux in the
$10-100$TeV range. Nevertheless, at energies $\gtrsim100$~TeV, we find that the
IceCube neutrino flux may still be accountable by AGN-driven winds if the
spectral index is as small as $\Gamma\sim2.0-2.1$. The detectability of
gamma-ray point sources also provides important constraints on such scenarios.

conductivity (AHC) has been thought to be zero when there is no net

and the Berry curvature predicts other possibilities, such as a large AHC in
non-colinear antiferromagnets with no net magnetization but net Berry
curvature. Vice versa, the AHE in principle could be tuned to zero,
irrespective of a finite magnetization. Here, we experimentally investigate
this possibility and demonstrate that, the symmetry elements of Heusler magnets
can be changed such that the Berry curvature and all the associated properties
are switched while leaving the magnetization unaffected. This enables us to
tune the AHC from 0 {\Omega}-1cm-1 up to 1600 {\Omega}-1cm-1 with an
exceptionally high anomalous Hall angle up to 12 %, while keeping the

the standard Schwarzschild black hole solutions when the scalar charge is zero
and the mass is positive. In addition, a parameter $\lambda$ in the metric
characterizes so-called 'hair'. The geodesic equations are used to examine the
behavior of the deflection angle in four relevant cases of the parameter
$\lambda$. Then, by introducing a simple coordinate transformation
$r^\lambda=S+v^2$ into the black hole metric, we were able to find a massless
wormhole solution of Einstein-Rosen (ER) \cite{Einstein} type with scalar
charge $S$. The programme is then repeated in terms of the Gauss--Bonnet
theorem in the weak field limit after a method is established to deal with the
angle of deflection using different domains of integration depending on the

angles reported in the literature. Finally, we have established the time delay

during inflation. In the context of General Relativity (GR), it has been shown
that the pair creation rate is exponentially decreasing during inflation.
Specifically, tiny black holes are favored in the early universe, but they can
grow with the horizon scale, as inflation approaches its end. At the same time,
cosmological, and not only, shortcomings of GR have triggered the pursuit for a
new, alternative theory of gravity. In this paper, by using probability
amplitudes from the No Boundary Proposal (NBP), we argue that any alternative
gravity should have a black hole creation rate similar to that of GR; that is,
in the early universe the creation of small black holes is in favor, while in
the late universe larger black holes are being exponentially suppressed. As an
example, we apply this argument in $f(R)$-theories of gravity and derive a
general formula for the rate in any $f(R)$-theory with constant curvature.
Finally, we consider well known $f(R)$-models and using this formula we put
constraints in their free parameters.

objectives besides high yield. Here, we analyze stage-dependent harvesting
strategies that realize PGY with conservation as a second objective. We show
that (1) PGY harvesting strategies can give large conservation benefits and (2)
equal harvesting rates of juveniles and adults is often a good strategy. These
conclusions are based on trade-off curves between yield and four measures of
conservation that form in two established population models, one age-structured
and one stage-structured model, when considering different harvesting rates of
juveniles and adults. These conclusions hold for a broad range of parameter
settings, though our investigation of robustness also reveals that (3)
predictions of the age-structured model are more sensitive to variations in
parameter values than those of the stage-structured model. Finally, we find
that (4) measures of stability that are often quite difficult to assess in the

negatively correlated with impacts on biomass and impact on size structure, so
that these later quantities can provide integrative signals to detect possible

atoms and the energy eigenvalues for which the incoming particle finally gets

Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation with a weak Gaussian noise which is
delta-correlated in time and has short-range spatial correlations. We study the
probability distribution of the interface height $H$ at a point of the
substrate, when the interface is initially flat. We show that, in a stark
contrast with the KPZ equation in $d<2$, this distribution approaches a
non-equilibrium steady state. The time of relaxation toward this state scales
as the diffusion time over the correlation length of the noise. We study the
steady-state distribution $\mathcal{P}(H)$ using the optimal-fluctuation
method. The typical, small fluctuations of height are Gaussian. For these
fluctuations the activation path of the system coincides with the time-reversed
relaxation path, and the variance of $\mathcal{P}(H)$ can be found from a
minimization of the (nonlocal) equilibrium free energy of the interface. In
contrast, the tails of $\mathcal{P}(H)$ are nonequilibrium, non-Gaussian and
strongly asymmetric. To determine them we calculate, analytically and
numerically, the activation paths of the system, which are different from the
time-reversed relaxation paths. We show that the slower-decaying tail of
$\mathcal{P}(H)$ scales as $-\ln \mathcal{P}(H) \propto |H|$, while the
faster-decaying tail scales as $-\ln \mathcal{P}(H) \propto |H|^3$. The
slower-decaying tail has important implications for the statistics of directed

translated into a different language and used without acknowledging the
original sources. One of the most common methods for detecting CLP requires
online machine translators (such as Google or Microsoft translate) which are
not always available, and given that plagiarism detection typically involves
large document comparison, the amount of translations required would overwhelm
an online machine translator, especially when detecting plagiarism over the
web. In addition, when translated texts are replaced with their synonyms, using
online machine translators to detect CLP would result in poor performance. This
paper addresses the problem of cross-lingual plagiarism detection (CLPD) by
proposing a model that uses simulated word embeddings to reproduce the
predictions of an online machine translator (Google translate) when detecting
CLP. The simulated embeddings comprise of translated words in different
languages mapped in a common space, and replicated to increase the prediction
probability of retrieving the translations of a word (and their synonyms) from
the model. Unlike most existing models, the proposed model does not require
parallel corpora, and accommodates multiple languages (multi-lingual). We
demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model in detecting CLP in
standard datasets that contain CLP cases, and evaluated its performance against
a state-of-the-art baseline that relies on online machine translator (T+MA
model). Evaluation results revealed that the proposed model is not only
effective in detecting CLP, it outperformed the baseline. The results indicate
that CLP could be detected with state-of-the-art performances by leveraging the
prediction accuracy of an internet translator with word embeddings, without
relying on internet translators.

iterative equation known as the Ikeda Map. In the linear regime, evolution of
optical power in the system shows power saturation behavior below the PT
threshold and exponential blow-up above the PT threshold. We found that in the
unbroken PT regime, optical power saturation occurs owing to the existence of
stable stationary states, which lies on the surface of 4-dimensional
hypersphere. Inclusion of Kerr nonlinearity into our model leads to the
emergence of a stable, chaotic and divergent region in the parameter basin for
period-1 cycle. A closer inspection into the system shows us that the largest
Lyapunov exponent blows up in the divergent region. It is found that the
existence of high non-negative largest Lyapunov exponent causes chaotic spiking
of optical power in the resonators.

simplicial complex. We study the problem of quantifying the interestingness of
subpopulations in a Mapper, which appear as long paths, flares, or loops.
First, we create a weighted directed graph G using the 1-skeleton of the
Mapper. We use the average values at the vertices of a target function to
direct edges (from low to high). The difference between the average values at
vertices (high-low) is set as the edge's weight. Covariation of the remaining h
functions (independent variables) is captured by a h-bit binary signature
assigned to the edge. An interesting path in G is a directed path whose edges
all have the same signature. We define the interestingness score of such a path
as a sum of its edge weights multiplied by a nonlinear function of their ranks
in the path.
  Second, we study three optimization problems on this graph G. In the problem
Max-IP, we seek an interesting path in G with the maximum interestingness
score. We show that Max-IP is NP-complete. For the special case when G is a
directed acyclic graph (DAG), we show that Max-IP can be solved in polynomial
time - in O(mnd_i) where d_i is the maximum indegree of a vertex in G.
  In the more general problem IP, the goal is to find a collection of
edge-disjoint interesting paths such that the overall sum of their
interestingness scores is maximized. We also study a variant of IP termed k-IP,
where the goal is to identify a collection of edge-disjoint interesting paths
each with k edges, and their total interestingness score is maximized. While
k-IP can be solved in polynomial time for k <= 2, we show k-IP is NP-complete
for k >= 3 even when G is a DAG. We develop polynomial time heuristics for IP

Internet of Things (SD-IoT) is a new computing paradigm that separates control
plane and data plane, and enables centralized logic control. In this paper, we
first present a general framework for SD-IoT, which consists of two main
components: SD-IoT controllers and SD-IoT switches. The controllers of SD-IoT
uses resource pooling technology, and the pool is responsible for the
centralized control of the entire network. The switches of SD-IoT integrate
with the gateway functions, which is responsible for data access and
forwarding. The SD-IoT controller pool is designed as a vertical control
architecture, which includes the main control layer and the base control layer.
The controller (main controller) of the main control layer interacts upward
with the application layer, interacts with the base control layer downwards,
and the controller (base controller) of the basic control layer interacts with
the data forwarding layer. We propose a dynamic balancing algorithm of the main
controller based on election mechanism and a dynamic load balancing algorithm
of the basic controller based on the balanced delay, respectively. The
experimental results show that the dynamic balancing algorithm based on the
election mechanism can ensure the consistency of the messages between the main
controllers, and the dynamic load balancing algorithm based on the balanced
delay can balance between these different workloads in the basic controllers.

pattern for each combination of surface energy and nanowire width is mapped for
both open-circuit and short-circuit boundary conditions. The results indicate a
narrow range of conditions where single vortices are energetically favorable:
nanowire widths less than about 30nm, open-circuit boundary condition, and
surface energy of less than 4N/m. Short-circuit boundary conditions tend to
favor the formation of a monodomain, while surface energy greater than 4N/m can
lead to the formation of complex domain patterns or loss of ferroelectricity.
The length scale at which a polarization vortex is energetically favorable is
smaller than the typical size of nanoparticle in recent experimental studies.

is its global nature, in which a parametric and physical model is fitted to the
data. Such physical modeling allows the user to constrain very general data
models, and jointly probe cosmological, astrophysical and instrumental
parameters. This approach also supports statistically robust goodness-of-fit
tests in terms of data-minus-model residual maps, which are essential for
identifying residual systematic effects in the data. The main challenges are
high code complexity and computational cost. Whether or not these costs are
justified for a given experiment depends on its final uncertainty budget. We
therefore predict that the importance of Bayesian component separation
techniques is likely to increase with time for intensity mapping experiments,

systems. DST estimates the user's goal at each user turn given the interaction
until then. State of the art approaches for state tracking rely on deep
learning methods, and represent dialogue state as a distribution over all
possible slot values for each slot present in the ontology. Such a
representation is not scalable when the set of possible values are unbounded
(e.g., date, time or location) or dynamic (e.g., movies or usernames).
Furthermore, training of such models requires labeled data, where each user
turn is annotated with the dialogue state, which makes building models for new
domains challenging. In this paper, we present a scalable multi-domain deep
learning based approach for DST. We introduce a novel framework for state
tracking which is independent of the slot value set, and represent the dialogue
state as a distribution over a set of values of interest (candidate set)
derived from the dialogue history or knowledge. Restricting these candidate
sets to be bounded in size addresses the problem of slot-scalability.
Furthermore, by leveraging the slot-independent architecture and transfer
learning, we show that our proposed approach facilitates quick adaptation to
new domains.

situations in which people are either fully aware of the economic consequences

but this uncertainty cannot be cleared in any way (e.g., sender-receiver game).
On the contrary, in reality, people oftentimes know that they will have a
chance to lie, they are initially uncertain about the economic consequences of
the available actions, but they can invest resources (e.g., time) to find them
out. Here we capture the essence of this type of situations by means of a novel
decision problem. Two experiments provide evidence of four empirical
regularities regarding the distribution of choices, and suggest that
participants vary along two dimensions: the moral cost of lying, and the cost
of investing time to find out the payoffs associated to the available actions.
Taking inspiration from these observations, we introduce a model that is
consistent with the main empirical results.

a composite system is specified by a collection of contracts that specify the
behavioural assumptions and guarantees of each component. In this paper, we
describe a unifying theory for reactive design contracts that provides the
basis for modelling and verification of reactive systems. We provide a language
for expression and composition of contracts that is supported by a rich
calculational theory. In contrast with other semantic models in the literature,
our theory of contracts allow us to specify both the evolution of state
variables and the permissible interactions with the environment. Moreover, our
model of interaction is abstract, and supports, for instance, discrete time,
continuous time, and hybrid computational models. Being based in Unifying
Theories of Programming (UTP), our theory can be composed with further
computational theories to support semantics for multi-paradigm languages.
Practical reasoning support is provided via our proof framework, Isabelle/UTP,
including a proof tactic that reduces a conjecture about a reactive program to
three predicates, symbolically characterising its assumptions and guarantees
about intermediate and final observations. This allows us to verify programs
with a large or infinite state space. Our work advances the state-of-the-art in
semantics for reactive languages, description of their contractual
specifications, and compositional verification.

element approximation for systems of non-linear conservation laws with general
geometric (h) and polynomial order (p) non-conforming rectangular meshes. The
crux of the proofs presented is that the nodal DG method is constructed with
the collocated Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto nodes. This choice ensures that the
derivative/mass matrix pair is a summation-by-parts (SBP) operator such that
entropy stability proofs from the continuous analysis are discretely mimicked.
Special attention is given to the coupling between nonconforming elements as we
demonstrate that the standard mortar approach for DG methods does not guarantee
entropy stability for non-linear problems, which can lead to instabilities. As
such, we describe a precise procedure and modify the mortar method to guarantee
entropy stability for general non-linear hyperbolic systems on h/p
non-conforming meshes. We verify the high-order accuracy and the entropy
conservation/stability of fully non-conforming approximation with numerical
examples.

without a constant (dc) bias, the SQUID exhibits extreme multistability at
frequencies around the (geometric) resonance. This effect is manifested by a
""snake-like"" form of the resonance curve. In the presence of both ac and dc
flux, multiple bifurcation sequences and secondary resonance branches appear at
frequencies above and below the geometric resonance. In the latter case, the
SQUID exhibits chaotic behavior in large regions of the parameter space; it is
also found that the state of the SQUID can be switched from chaotic to periodic
or vice versa by a slight variation of the dc flux.

formal cone of avoidance due to the discreteness of the GC system. The
ambiguity allows the construction of the representation of voids in the GC
system by a set of largest-radius meridional cylindrical voids to be overcome.
As a result of our study, we have managed to identify northern and southern
axial zones of avoidance with similar characteristics. The combined zone of
avoidance is traceable at $|Z| \gtrsim 1$ kpc and is similar in shape to a
double cone whose axis crosses the region of greatest GC number density. By
modeling the distribution of Galactocentric latitudes for GCs, we have
determined the half-angle of the cone of avoidance ${\alpha}_0 =
15.0^{+2.1}_{-4.1}$ deg and the distance to the Galactic center $R_0 = 7.3 \pm
0.5$ kpc (in the scale of the Harris (1996) catalog, the 2010 version) as the

objects only leads to an estimate of $R_0 = 7.2 \pm 0.5|_{stat} \pm
0.3|_{calib}$ kpc. The probability that the zone of avoidance at the
characteristics found is random in nature is $\le 2\%$. We have revealed
evidence for the elongation of the zone of avoidance in the direction
orthogonal to the center--anticenter axis, which, just as the north--south
difference in this zone, may be attributable to the influence of the Magellanic

near a wall that moves with discrete steps. When the particle diffuse away from

Elementary calculations of the model reproduce established results for the

particles and $v_c\sim$ Const for small particles, $r$ being the particle's
radius. Using our model we calculate the dragging distance of the particle by
treating the pushing as a sequence of growing steps by the surface, each
enabled by the particle's diffusion away. Eventually the particle is engulfed
by ice growing around it when a rare event of long diffusion time away from the
surface occurs. By calculating numerically the statistics of the diffusion
times from the surface and therefore the probability for a such a rare event we
calculate the total dragging time and distance $L$ of the particle by the ice
front to be $L\sim\exp[1/(vr)]$ where $v$ is the freezing velocity. This
relation for $L$ is confirmed by ours and others experiments. The distance $L$
provides a length scale for pattern formation during phase transition in
colloidal suspensions, such as ice lenses and lamellae structures by freeze
casting. Data from the literature for ice lenses thickness and lamellae spacing
during freeze casting agree with our prediction for the relation of the

to aggregate and identify both data analyzed and data generated by a research
project will advance the field of astronomy to match best practices in other
research fields like geosciences and medicine. Increase in the use of DOIs will
prepare the discipline for changing expectations among funding agencies and
publishers, who increasingly expect accurate and thorough data citation to
accompany scientific outputs. The use of DOIs ensures a robust, sustainable,
and interoperable approach to data citation in which due credit is given to
researchers and institutions who produce and maintain the primary data. We
describe in this work the advantages of DOIs for data citation and best
practices for integrating a DOI service in an astronomical archive. We report
on a pilot project carried out in collaboration with AAS Journals. During the
course of the 1.5 year pilot, over 75% of submitting authors opted to use the
integrated DOI service to clearly identify data analyzed during their research
project when prompted at the time of paper submission.

submicron CMOS inverters. The model is inspired by the key observation that the
inverter delay is a complicated function of several process parameters as well
as load capacitance. These relationships are considered by fitting functions
for each parameter derived from the Curve Fitting Toolbox in Matlab. Compared
to SPICE simulations based on the BSIM4 transistor model, the analytical delay
model shows very good accuracy with an average error less than 2% over a wide
range of process parameters and output loads. Hence, the proposed model can be
efficiently used for different technology nodes as well as statistical gate
delay characterisation.

  Counterflow Flames","Preprint submitted to Proceedings of the Combustion Institute",,,,"physics.chem-ph physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The formation mechanisms of aromatic compounds in flame are strongly
influenced by the chemical and thermal history that leads to their formation.
Indeed, the complex environments that characterize combustion systems do not
only affect the composition of gas-phase species, but they also determine the
structure and the characteristics of the soot precursors generated. To
illustrate the importance of these effects, in this work we investigate the
growth mechanisms of soot precursors in an atmospheric-pressure
ethylene/oxygen/argon counterflow diffusion flame, using a combination of
computational and experimental techniques. In diffusion flames, flow
characteristics play an important role in the formation, growth, and oxidation
of particles, and soot precursors are strongly affected by the flame location.
Fluid dynamics simulations and stochastic discrete modeling were employed
together to identify key reaction pathways along various flow streamlines. The
models were validated with experimental mass spectra obtained using aerosol
mass spectrometry coupled with vacuum-ultraviolet photoionization. Results show
that both the hydrogen-abstraction-acetylene-addition mechanism and
oxygen-insertion reactions are responsible for the molecular growth, and their
relative importance is determined by the flame conditions along the
streamlines. Oxygenated species were detected in regions of high temperature,
high atomic oxygen concentration, and relatively low acetylene abundance. This
study also emphasizes the need to model the counterflow flame in three
dimensions to capture the spatial dependence on growth mechanisms of soot
precursors.

the sum of two primes. Let $D(N)$ denote the number of such prime
decompositions for an even $N$. It is known that $D(N)$ can be bounded above by
$$ D(N) \leq C^* \Theta(N), \quad \Theta(N):= \frac{N}{\log^2
N}\prod_{\substack{p|N p>2}} \left( 1 +
\frac{1}{p-2}\right)\prod_{p>2}\left(1-\frac{1}{(p-1)^2}\right) $$ where $C^*$
denotes Chen's constant. It is conjectured that $C^*=2$. In 2004, Wu showed
that $C^* \leq 7.8209$. We attempted to replicate his work in computing Chen's
constant, and in doing so we provide an improved approximation of the Buchstab
function $\omega(u)$, \begin{align*} \omega(u)=1/u, & \quad (1\leq u\leq 2), (u
\omega(u))'=\omega(u-1), & \quad (u\geq 2). \end{align*} based on work done by
Cheer and Goldston. For each interval $[j,j+1]$, they expressed $\omega(u)$ as
a Taylor expansion about $u=j+1$. We expanded about the point $u=j+0.5$, so
$\omega(u)$ was never evaluated more than $0.5$ away from the center of the
Taylor expansion, which gave much stronger error bounds.
  Issues arose while using this Taylor expansion to compute the required
integrals for Chen's constant, so we proceeded with solving the above
differential equation to obtain $\omega(u)$, and then integrating the result.
Although the values that were obtained undershot Wu's results, we pressed on
and refined Wu's work by discretising his integrals with finer granularity. The
improvements to Chen's constant were negligible (as predicted by Wu). This
provides experimental evidence, but not a proof, that were Wu's integrals
computed on smaller intervals in exact form, the improvement to Chen's constant
would be negligible. Thus, any substantial improvement on Chen's constant
likely requires a radically different method to what Wu provided.

across the images. The matched local features between different images can
indicate the similarities of their content. Resilience of image feature
matching to large view point changes is challenging for a lot of applications
such as 3D object reconstruction, object recognition and navigation, etc, which
need accurate and robust feature matching from quite different view points. In
this paper we propose a novel image feature matching algorithm, integrating our
previous proposed Affine Invariant Feature Detector (AIFD) and new proposed
Affine Invariant Feature Descriptor (AIFDd). Both stages of this new proposed
algorithm can provide sufficient resilience to view point changes. With
systematic experiments, we can prove that the proposed method of feature
detector and descriptor outperforms other state-of-the-art feature matching
algorithms especially on view points robustness. It also performs well under
other conditions such as the change of illumination, rotation and compression,
etc.
