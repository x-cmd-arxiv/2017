antenna array that provides wireless service to ground users is investigated.
In particular, under the goal of minimizing the airborne service time needed
for communicating with ground users, a novel framework for deploying and
operating a drone-based antenna array system whose elements are single-antenna
drones is proposed. In the considered model, the service time is minimized by
minimizing the wireless transmission time as well as the control time that is
needed for movement and stabilization of the drones. To minimize the
transmission time, first, the antenna array gain is maximized by optimizing the
drone spacing within the array. In this case, using perturbation techniques,
the drone spacing optimization problem is addressed by solving successive,
perturbed convex optimization problems. Then, the optimal locations of the
drones around the array's center are derived such that the transmission time
for the user is minimized. Given the determined optimal locations of drones,
the drones must spend a control time to adjust their positions dynamically so
as to serve multiple users. To minimize this control time of the quadrotor
drones, the speed of rotors is optimally adjusted based on both the
destinations of the drones and external forces (e.g., wind and gravity). In
particular, using bang-bang control theory, the optimal rotors' speeds as well
as the minimum control time are derived in closed-form. Simulation results show
that the proposed approach can significantly reduce the service time to ground
users compared to a fixed-array case in which the same number of drones form a
fixed uniform antenna array. The results also show that, in comparison with the
fixed-array case, the network's spectral efficiency can be improved by 32%
while leveraging the drone antenna array system.

dominant face of the multiple access channel capacity using a standard low
complexity decoder. This technique is built upon recent theoretical
developments of Zhu and Gastpar on compute-forward multiple access (CFMA) which
achieves the capacity of the multiple access channel using a sequential
decoder. We illustrate this strategy with off-the-shelf LDPC codes. In the
first stage of decoding, the receiver first recovers a linear combination of
the transmitted codewords using the sum-product algorithm (SPA). In the second
stage, by using the recovered sum-of-codewords as side information, the
receiver recovers one of the two codewords using a modified SPA, ultimately
recovering both codewords. The main benefit of recovering the sum-of-codewords
instead of the codeword itself is that it allows to attain points on the
dominant face of the multiple access channel capacity without the need of
rate-splitting or time sharing while maintaining a low complexity in the order
of a standard point-to-point decoder. This property is also shown to be crucial
for some applications, e.g., interference channels. For all the simulations
with single-layer binary codes, our proposed practical strategy is shown to be
within \SI{1.7}{\decibel} of the theoretical limits, without explicit
optimization on the off-the-self LDPC codes.

point-to-point channels with non-causal encoder channel state information

stealth-wiretap codes is shown to induce a good sequence of codes for a
corresponding GPC. Consequently, the framework enables exploiting existing
results for GPCs to produce converse proofs for their wiretap analogs. The
analogy readily extends to multiuser broadcasting scenarios, encompassing
broadcast channels (BCs) with deterministic components, degradation ordering
between users, and BCs with cooperative receivers. Given a wiretap BC (WTBC)
with two receivers and one eavesdropper, an analogous Gelfand-Pinsker BC (GPBC)
is constructed by converting the eavesdropper's observation sequence into a
state sequence with an appropriate product distribution (induced by the
stealth-wiretap code for the WTBC), and non-causally revealing the states to
the encoder. The transition matrix of the state-dependent GPBC is extracted
from WTBC's transition law, with the eavesdropper's output playing the role of
the channel state. Past capacity results for the semi-deterministic (SD) GPBC
and the physically-degraded (PD) GPBC with an informed receiver are leveraged
to furnish analogy-based converse proofs for the analogous WTBC setups. This
characterizes the secrecy-capacity regions of the SD-WTBC and the PD-WTBC, in

the two ingredients we are able to describe the bulk evolution and the
fluctutations within the same framework. Critical slowing down means that
equilibration of fluctuations could be as slow as hydrodynamic evolution and
thus fluctuations could significantly deviate from equilibrium near the
critical point. We generalize hydrodynamics to partial-equilibrium conditions
where the state of the system is characterized by the off-equilibrium magnitude
of fluctuations in addition to the usual hydrodynamic variables -- conserved
densities. We find that the key element of the new formalism -- the extended
entropy taking into account the off-equilibrium fluctuations -- is remarkably
similar to the 2PI action in quantum field theory. We show how the new Hydro+
formalism reproduces two major effects of critical fluctuations on the bulk
evolution: the strong frequency dependence of the anomalously large bulk
viscosity as well as the stiffening of the equation of state with increasing
frequency or wave-number. While the agreement with known results confirms its
validity, the fact that Hydro+ achieves this within a local and deterministic

"1712.10309","Victor Thompson Vt","Victor Thompson","Methods for Detecting Paraphrase Plagiarism",,,,,"cs.IR cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Paraphrase plagiarism is one of the difficult challenges facing plagiarism
detection systems. Paraphrasing occur when texts are lexically or syntactically
altered to look different, but retain their original meaning. Most plagiarism
detection systems (many of which are commercial based) are designed to detect
word co-occurrences and light modifications, but are unable to detect severe
semantic and structural alterations such as what is seen in many academic
documents. Hence many paraphrase plagiarism cases go undetected. In this paper,
we approached the problem of paraphrase plagiarism by proposing methods for
detecting the most common techniques (phenomena) used in paraphrasing texts
(namely; lexical substitution, insertion/deletion and word and phrase
reordering), and combined the methods into a paraphrase detection model. We
evaluated our proposed methods and model on collections containing paraphrase
texts. Experimental results show significant improvement in performance when
the methods were combined (the proposed model) as opposed to running them
individually. The results also show that the proposed paraphrase detection
model outperformed a standard baseline (based on greedy string tilling), and
previous studies.

circumstellar disks, and demonstrate the superiority of NMF: with no need for
prior selection of references, NMF can detect fainter circumstellar disks,
better preserve low order disk morphology, and does not require forward
modeling. As an application to a well-known disk example, we process the
archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) STIS coronagraphic observations of

exponential growth and ballistic butterfly spreading of OTOCs across different

finite $\hbar$ and to all orders in derivatives. The scrambling of a generic
few-body operator in a chaotic system is described as building up a
""hydrodynamic cloud,"" and the exponential growth of the cloud arises from a
shift symmetry of the hydrodynamic action. The shift symmetry also shields
correlation functions of the energy density and flux, and time ordered
correlation functions of generic operators from exponential growth, while leads
to chaotic behavior in OTOCs. The theory also predicts an interesting
phenomenon of the skipping of a pole at special values of complex frequency and
momentum in two-point functions of energy density and flux. This pole-skipping
phenomenon may be considered as a ""smoking gun"" for the hydrodynamic origin of
the chaotic mode. We also discuss the possibility that such a hydrodynamic

spontaneously broken in this theory if the measured ground state energy is

have not traditionally included interaction as a significant power source.
However, recent campaigns to observe SNe within days of explosion have revealed
narrow emission lines of high-ionization species in the earliest spectra of
luminous SNe II of all subclasses. These ""flash ionization"" features indicate
the presence of a confined shell of material around the progenitor star. Here
we present the first low-luminosity (LL) SN to show flash ionization features,
SN 2016bkv. This SN peaked at $M_V = -16$ mag and has H{\alpha} expansion
velocities under 1350 km/s around maximum light, placing it at the faint/slow
end of the distribution of SNe IIP (similar to SN 2005cs). The light-curve
shape of SN 2016bkv is also extreme among SNe IIP. A very strong initial peak
could indicate additional luminosity from circumstellar interaction. A very
small fall from the plateau to the nickel tail indicates unusually large
production of radioactive nickel compared to other LL SNe IIP. A comparison
between nebular spectra of SN 2016bkv and models raises the possibility that SN
2016bkv is an electron-capture supernova.

become crucial. The demand for data will continue to grow as smart gadgets
multiply and become increasingly integrated into our daily lives.
Next-generation industries in artificial intelligence services and
high-performance computing are so far supported by microelectronic platforms.
These data-intensive enterprises rely on continual improvements in hardware.
Their prospects are running up against a stark reality: conventional
one-size-fits-all solutions offered by digital electronics can no longer
satisfy this need, as Moore's law (exponential hardware scaling),
interconnection density, and the von Neumann architecture reach their limits.
  With its superior speed and reconfigurability, analog photonics can provide
some relief to these problems; however, complex applications of analog
photonics have remained largely unexplored due to the absence of a robust
photonic integration industry. Recently, the landscape for
commercially-manufacturable photonic chips has been changing rapidly and now
promises to achieve economies of scale previously enjoyed solely by
microelectronics.
  The scientific community has set out to build bridges between the domains of
photonic device physics and neural networks, giving rise to the field of
\emph{neuromorphic photonics}. This article reviews the recent progress in
integrated neuromorphic photonics. We provide an overview of neuromorphic
computing, discuss the associated technology (microelectronic and photonic)
platforms and compare their metric performance. We discuss photonic neural
network approaches and challenges for integrated neuromorphic photonic
processors while providing an in-depth description of photonic neurons and a
candidate interconnection architecture. We conclude with a future outlook of
neuro-inspired photonic processing.

realistic turbulent flows such as the flat plate boundary layer modelled by the
Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. Two new manufactured
solutions (MSs) are introduced with demonstrated ability to verify the
treatment of slip and no-slip boundary conditions in high-order frameworks on
curved domains. These MSs serve as well to discuss the impact of the method of
computation of boundary normals on the order of accuracy (OOA) of the solution
at the wall. Furthermore, two turbulent boundary layer MSs from literature,
devised to mimic the genuine features of RANS-modelled flows in the vicinity of
wall, are compared in terms of their suitability to achieving high-order
accuracy. A number of useful concepts in verification are explored through
these cases such as the limit values of the Spalart-Allmaras (SA) turbulence
model source terms at the wall, the verification of the modified vorticity term
of the modified SA model, the grid sensitivity of wall-bounded turbulent flows,
the inadequacy of substituting solution verification to code verification and
the effect of non-dimensionalization of the solution on the minimization of
iterative errors via residual convergence. In all cases, demonstrations are
carried for orders of accuracy up to the sixth.

$\xi$-$q$-summability of Szlenk index. This fact allows us to prove that the
behavior of operators under the $\alpha_{\xi,p}$ seminorms passes in the
strongest way to injective tensor products of Banach spaces. Furthermore, we

Banach space with good behavior with respect to the $\alpha_{\xi,p}$ seminorm

J0348-0432 requires the compact star matter to be described by a stiff equation
of state (EoS). Presence of hyperons in neutron stars leads to a softening of
the EoS that results in a decrease of the maximum neutron-star mass below the
measured values of masses for PSR J1614-2230 and PSR J0348-0432 pulsars if one
exploits ordinary relativistic mean-field (RMF) models (hyperon puzzle).
However, within an RMF EoS with a sigma-scaled hadron effective masses and
coupling constants, the maximum neutron-star mass remains above $2M_{\odot}$
even when hyperons are included. Also, other important constraints on the
equation of state, e.g. the flow constraint from heavy-ion collisions are to be

neutrino luminosity that substantially exceeds that of the modified Urca

consistent with the direct Urca reactions ($n\to p+e^{-}+\bar{\nu}_{e}$ and
inverse) occurring in a small fraction of the core. Observations of the thermal
relaxation of the neutron star crust following 2.5 years of accretion allow us
to measure the energy deposited into the core during accretion, which is then
reradiated as neutrinos, and infer the core temperature. For a nucleonic core,
this requires that the nucleons are unpaired and that the proton fraction
exceed a critical value to allow the direct Urca reaction to proceed. The
neutron star in MXB~1659-29 is the first with a firmly detected thermal
component in its X-ray spectrum that needs a fast neutrino cooling process.
Measurements of the temperature variation of the neutron star core during
quiescence would place an upper limit on the core specific heat and serve as a
check on the fraction of the neutron star core in which nucleons are unpaired.

given area and is equipped with $M$ antennas to serve $K$ user equipments
(UEs). A multislope (distance-dependent) path loss model is considered and
linear processing is used, under the assumption that channel state information
is acquired by using pilot sequences (reused across the network). Within this
setting, a lower bound on the UL spectral efficiency and a realistic circuit
power consumption model are used to evaluate the network EE. Numerical results
are first used to compute the optimal BS density and pilot reuse factor for a
Massive MIMO network with three different detection schemes, namely, maximum
ratio combining, zero-forcing (ZF) and multicell minimum mean-squared error.
The numerical analysis shows that the EE is a unimodal function of BS density
and achieves its maximum for a relatively small density of BS, irrespective of
the employed detection scheme. This is in contrast to the single-slope
(distance-independent) path loss model, for which the EE is a monotonic
non-decreasing function of BS density. Then, we concentrate on ZF and use
stochastic geometry to compute a new lower bound on the spectral efficiency,
which is then used to optimize, for a given BS density, the pilot reuse factor,
number of BS antennas and UEs. Closed- form expressions are computed from which
valuable insights into the interplay between optimization variables, hardware
characteristics, and propagation environment are obtained.

last two authors. The cyclic descent set restricts to the usual descent set
when the largest value is ignored, and has the property that the number of SYT
of a given shape with a given cyclic descent set $D$ is invariant under cyclic
shifts of the entries of $D$. Following these results, the existence of cyclic
descent sets for standard Young tableaux of any skew shape other than a ribbon
was conjectured by the authors, and recently proved by Adin, Reiner and
Roichman. Unfortunately, the proof does not provide a natural definition of the
cyclic descent set for a specific tableau.
  In this paper we explicitly describe cyclic descent sets and resulting
generating functions for SYT of (possibly skew) shapes which either have
exactly two rows or are near-hooks, i.e., are one cell away from a hook. Our
definition provides a constructive combinatorial proof of the existence of
cyclic descent sets for these shapes, and coincides with that of Rhoades for
two-row rectangular shapes. We also show that cyclic descent sets for near-hook
shaped tableaux are unique.

weather forecasting, open channel hydraulics and simulation-based natural
hazard assessment. In these applications the shallowness of the process
motivates depth-averaging. While the shallow flow formulation is advantageous
in terms of computational efficiency, it also comes at the price of losing
vertical information such as the flow's velocity profile. This gives rise to a
model error, which limits the shallow flow model's predictive power and is
often not explicitly quantifiable.
  We propose the use of vertical moments to overcome this problem. The shallow
moment approximation preserves information on the vertical flow structure while
still making use of the simplifying framework of depth-averaging. In this
article, we derive a generic shallow flow moment system of arbitrary order
starting from a set of balance laws, which has been reduced by scaling
arguments. The derivation is based on a fully vertically resolved reference
model with the vertical coordinate mapped onto the unit interval. We specify
the shallow flow moment hierarchy for kinematic and Newtonian flow conditions
and present 1D numerical results for shallow moment systems up to third order.
Finally, we assess their performance with respect to both the standard shallow
flow equations as well as with respect to the vertically resolved reference
model. Our results show that depending on the parameter regime, e.g. friction
and slip, shallow moment approximations significantly reduce the model error in
shallow flow regimes and have a lot of potential to increase the predictive
power of shallow flow models, while keeping them computationally cost
efficient.

of the evolution of the polarized state in the dark on the concentration of NV
centers. At low excitation power, we observed a simple exponential decay
profile in the low-density regime and a paradoxical inverted exponential
profile in the high-density regime. At higher excitation power, we observed
complex behavior, with an initial sharp rise in luminescence signal after the
preparation pulse followed by a slower exponential decay. Magnetic field and
excitation laser power-dependent measurements suggest that the rapid initial
increase of the luminescence signal is related to recharging of the
nitrogen-vacancy centers (from neutral to negatively charged) in the dark. The
slow relaxing component corresponds to the longitudinal spin relaxation of the
NV ensemble. The shape of the decay profile reflects the interplay between two
mechanisms: the NV charge state conversion in the dark and the longitudinal
spin relaxation. These mechanisms, in turn, are influenced by ionization,
recharging and polarization dynamics during excitation. Interestingly, we found
that charge dynamics are dominant in NV-dense samples even at very feeble
excitation power. These observations may be important for the use of ensembles
of NV centers in precession magnetometry and sensing applications.

captures the notion of distance well but also yields closed-form solutions. In
this paper, we consider a more general class of f-divergences and derive the

the derivative of the convex conjugate function to f and includes the KL

on a one-parameter family of $\alpha$-divergences to study effects of the
choice of divergence on policy improvement. Previously known as well as new

chosen f-divergence. Interestingly, the mean-squared Bellman error minimization
is closely related to policy evaluation with the Pearson $\chi^2$-divergence
penalty, while the KL divergence results in the soft-max policy update and a

quantum level using a multi-time wave function $\psi(x_1,...,x_N)$, i.e., a
wave function depending on one spacetime variable $x_i = (t_i,\mathbf{x}_i)$
per particle. In particular, such a wave function makes it possible to
implement direct interaction along light cones (not mediated by fields), as in
the Wheeler-Feynman formulation of electrodynamics. Our results are as follows.
(1) We derive a covariant two-particle integral equation and discuss it in
detail. (2) It is shown how this integral equation (or equivalently, a system
of two integro-differential equations) can be understood as defining the time
evolution of $\psi$ in a consistent way. (3) We demonstrate that the equation
has strong analogies with Wheeler-Feynman electrodynamics and therefore
suggests a possible new quantization of that theory. (4) We propose two natural
ways how the two-particle equation can be extended to $N$ particles. It is
shown that exactly one of them leads to the usual Schr\""odinger equation with
Coulomb-type pair potentials if time delay effects are neglected.

desired motor command. Understanding how the brain orchestrates the necessary
synaptic modifications across different brain areas has remained a longstanding
puzzle. Here, we introduce a multi-area neuronal network model in which
synaptic plasticity continuously adapts the network towards a global desired
output. In this model synaptic learning is driven by a local dendritic
prediction error that arises from a failure to predict the top-down input given
the bottom-up activities. Such errors occur at apical dendrites of pyramidal
neurons where both long-range excitatory feedback and local inhibitory
predictions are integrated. When local inhibition fails to match excitatory
feedback an error occurs which triggers plasticity at bottom-up synapses at
basal dendrites of the same pyramidal neurons. We demonstrate the learning
capabilities of the model in a number of tasks and show that it approximates
the classical error backpropagation algorithm. Finally, complementing this
cortical circuit with a disinhibitory mechanism enables attention-like stimulus
denoising and generation. Our framework makes several experimental predictions
on the function of dendritic integration and cortical microcircuits, is
consistent with recent observations of cross-area learning, and suggests a
biological implementation of deep learning.

halo mass dependence of $\tau_\alpha$. The unique free parameter in our model,
a pivot value of $\tau_\alpha$, is calibrated so as to reproduce the $z=5.7$

explain all observations reasonably. Therefore, a simple model of one-to-one

That is, large intrinsic spin-orbit coupling is not an essential requirement

parameter $\varepsilon>0$ and discuss the validity of formal asymptotic
expansions of solutions near the sharp interface limit $\varepsilon\approx0$.
We assume that the corresponding ODE system has two stable equilibria. As in
the scalar Allen--Cahn equation, it is known that the motion of the sharp
interfaces of such systems is governed by the mean curvature flow with a
driving force. The formal expansion also suggests that the profile of the
transition layers converges to that of a traveling wave solution as
$\varepsilon\rightarrow0$. In this paper, we rigorously verify this latter
ansatz for a large class of initial data.
  The proof relies on a rescaling argument, the super--subsolution method and a
Liouville type theorem for eternal solutions of parabolic systems. Roughly
speaking, the Liouville type theorem states that any eternal solution that lies
between two traveling waves is itself a traveling wave. The same Liouville type
theorem was established for the scalar Allen--Cahn equation by Berestycki and
Hamel. In view of their importance, we prove the Liouville type theorems in a
rather general framework, not only for two-species competition-diffusion
systems but also for $m$-species cooperation-diffusion systems possibly with
time periodic or spatially periodic coefficients.

gathering step in which representative programs are collected from various
application domains. Processor performance, when running the workload set, is
profiled using simulators that model the targeted processor architecture.
However, simulating the entire workload set is prohibitively time-consuming,
which precludes considering a large number of programs. To reduce simulation
time, several techniques in the literature have exploited the internal program
repetitiveness to extract and execute only representative code segments.
Existing so- lutions are based on reducing cross-program computational
redundancy or on eliminating internal-program redundancy to decrease execution
time. In this work, we propose an orthogonal and complementary loop- centric
methodology that targets loop-dominant programs by exploiting internal-program
characteristics to reduce cross-program computational redundancy. The approach
employs a newly developed framework that extracts and analyzes core loops
within workloads. The collected characteristics model memory behavior,
computational complexity, and data structures of a program, and are used to
construct a signature vector for each program. From these vectors,
cross-workload similarity metrics are extracted, which are processed by a novel
heuristic to exclude similar programs and reduce redundancy within the set.
Finally, a reverse engineering approach that synthesizes executable
micro-benchmarks having the same instruction mix as the loops in the original
workload is introduced. A tool that automates the flow steps of the proposed
methodology is developed. Simulation results demonstrate that applying the
proposed methodology to a set of workloads reduces the set size by half, while
preserving the main characterizations of the initial workloads.

Meanwhile, Internet access providers (IAPs) feel that revenues from end-users

Consequently, some IAPs have begun to offer CPs a new type of peering
agreement, called paid peering, under which they provide CPs with better data
delivery quality for a fee. In this paper, we model a network platform where an
IAP makes decisions on the peering types offered to CPs and the prices charged
to CPs and end-users. We study the optimal peering schemes for the IAP, i.e.,
to offer CPs both the paid and settlement-free peering to choose from or only
one of them, as the objective is profit or welfare maximization. Our results
show that 1) the IAP should always offer the paid and settlement-free peering
under the profit-optimal and welfare-optimal schemes, respectively, 2) whether

then used to augment the base word representations. The design of our approach

experiments on three popular benchmarks, SNLI, MultiNLI and SciTail, achieving
competitive performance on all. A lightweight parameterization of our model
also enjoys a $\approx 3$ times reduction in parameter size compared to the
existing state-of-the-art models, e.g., ESIM and DIIN, while maintaining
competitive performance. Additionally, visual analysis shows that our

the ordinary $H_3^{+}$ and $H_3$ and the primitive tri-atomic molecular system,
$H_3^{++}$, which, as is shown, behaves differently. The study is carried out
by comparing the topological features of these systems as they are reflected
through their non-adiabatic coupling terms. Although the $H_3^{++}$ is not
known to exist as a molecule, we found that it behaves as such at intermediate
distances. However this illusion breaks down as its asymptotic region is
reached. Our study indicates that whereas $H_3^{+}$ and $H_3$ dissociate
smoothly, the $H_3^{++}$, does not seem to do so. Nevertheless, the fact that
$H_3^{++}$ is capable of living as a molecule on borrowed time enables it to
catch an electron and form a molecule via the reaction $H_3^{++} + e \to
H_3^{+}$ that may dissociate properly: $H_3^{+} \to H^{+} + H_2$ or $H +
H_2^+$. Thus, the two unique features acquired by $H_3^{++}$ namely, that it is
the most primitive system formed by three protons and one electron and
topologically, still remain for an instant a molecule, may make it the sole
candidate for becoming the \bold{cornerstone} for creating the molecules.

a basic algorithm that adopts a distribution-based thresholding rule. For very

first performs a random partitioning to divide predictors into subsets of
manageable size of order $O(n^{2-\delta})$ for variable screening, where
$\delta >0$ can be an arbitrarily small positive number. Random partitioning is
repeated a few times. Next, the final estimate of variable subset is obtained
by integrating results obtained from multiple random partitions. Simulation
studies show that our method works well and outperforms some renowned
competitors. Real data applications are presented. Our algorithms are able to
handle predictors in the size of millions.

for higher capacity in cellular networks. The major problem faced in such
networks is the wireless backhaul link and its limited capacity. Caching most
popular files in the memories of small cells base station (SBSs) is an
effective solution to this problem. One of the main challenges in caching is
choosing the files that are going to be stored in the memory of SBS. In this
paper, we model the described caching problem as a graph. This graph is divided
into four sub-graphs including placement, access, SBSs and delivery graphs. By
making some modifications to the SBS graph, we convert it to a graph that can
be colored. Coloring of the generated graph is NP-hard and we use an algorithm
proposed in graph-coloring area to color it. To overcome the complexity of
above coloring technique, we then propose a simple graph-coloring method based
on two point processes, Matern Core-type I and II. We model our network with a
new weighted graph which simply can be colored and after that the files are
cached accordingly. We evaluate the performance of our proposed methods through
simulations. Our results show that by employing out proposed method in a
typical considered SBSs network, the load on the macro base station can be
reduced by around $25 \%$, at the distribution parameter of popularity of files
equals to $0.6$, compared to conventional policy which caches the most popular
content every where.

Arsove and Leutwiler. Due to the work of Eriksson and Leutwiler, this notion
also turned out to be an effective tool by investigating the extreme structure
of operator segments. This paper has multiple purposes which are interwoven,
and are intended to be equally important. On the one hand, we identify
quasi-units as orthogonal projections acting on an appropriate auxiliary
Hilbert space. As projections form a lattice and are extremal points of the
effect algebra, we conclude the same properties for quasi-units. Our second aim
is to apply these results for nonnegative sesquilinear forms. Constructing an
order preserving bijection between operator- and form segments, we provide a
characterization of being extremal in the convexity sense, and we give a
necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the greatest lower
bound of two forms. Closing the paper we revisit some statements by using the

explored. Different from traditional shortest-path trees (SPT) and graph

it needs to support dynamic group membership and optimize a sequence of

scalability of SDN due to limited TCAM is also crucial. In this paper,
therefore, we formulate a new optimization problem, named Online Branch-aware

application of the Laplacian to the original PA source. As typical PA sources
consist of smooth parts and singularities along interfaces the Laplacian of the

$\beta$ is the inverse temperature and $N$ is the system size. Such scaling
behavior has greatly hampered the accessibility of the universal infrared (IR)
physics of many interesting correlated electron models at (2+1)D, let alone
(3+1)D. To reduce the computational complexity, we develop a new QMC method
with inhomogeneous momentum-space mesh, dubbed elective momentum ultra-size
quantum Monte Carlo (EQMC) method. Instead of treating all fermionic
excitations on an equal footing as in conventional QMC methods, by converting
the fermion determinant into the momentum space, our method focuses on fermion
modes that are directly associated with low-energy (IR) physics in the vicinity
of the so-called hot-spots, while other fermion modes irrelevant for universal
properties are ignored. As shown in the manuscript, for any cutoff-independent
quantities, e.g. scaling exponents, this method can achieve the same level of
accuracy with orders of magnitude increase in computational efficiency. We
demonstrate this method with a model of antiferromagnetic itinerant quantum
critical point, realized via coupling itinerant fermions with a frustrated
transverse-field Ising model on a triangle lattice. The system size of $48

In this paper, we address a new problem of detecting overlapping community
structures in the context of such an incomplete network, where communities in
the network are allowed to overlap since nodes belong to multiple communities
at once. To solve this problem, we introduce KroMFac, a new framework that
conducts community detection via regularized nonnegative matrix factorization
(NMF) based on the Kronecker graph model. Specifically, from an inferred
Kronecker generative parameter matrix, we first estimate the missing part of
the network. As our major contribution to the proposed framework, to improve
community detection accuracy, we then characterize and select influential nodes
(which tend to have high degrees) by ranking, and add them to the existing
graph. Finally, we uncover the community structures by solving the regularized
NMF-aided optimization problem in terms of maximizing the likelihood of the
underlying graph. Furthermore, adopting normalized mutual information (NMI), we
empirically show superiority of our KroMFac approach over two baseline schemes
by using both synthetic and real-world networks.

evaporation of charged black holes. Within the proposed model, the back
reaction of Hawking radiation is considered. More specifically, we consider the
equation $G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi \langle T_{\mu\nu}\rangle$, in which the matter
content $\langle T_{\mu\nu}\rangle$ is assumed spherically symmetric. With this
equation of motion, the asymptotic behavior of the model is analyzed. Two kinds
of matter contents are taken into consideration in this paper. In the first
case (the thin-shell model), the infalling matter is simulated by a null-like
charged sphere collapsing into its center. In the second case, we consider a
continuous distribution of spherical symmetric infalling null-like charged
matter. It is simulated by taking the continuous limit of many co-centric
spheres collapsing into the center. We find that in the thin-shell case, an
event horizon forms and the shell passes through the horizon before becoming
extremal, provided that it is not initially near-extremal. In the case of
continuous matter distribution, we consider explicitly an extremal center
covered by neutral infalling matter and find that the event horizon also forms.
The black hole itself will become near-extremal eventually, leaving possibly a
non-electromagnetic energy residue less than the order of
$\ell_{p}^{4}/e_{0}^{3}$. The details of the behavior of these models are
explicitly worked out in this paper.

a mean field description and use the tight binding approximation and the
averaging method to derive averaged model equations in the form of two coupled
discrete nonlinear Schr\""odinger equations (DNLSE) with tunneling constants
that nonlinearly depend on the inter-species coupling. We show that for strong
and rapid modulations of the inter-species scattering length, the averaged
system admits exact compacton solutions, e.g. solutions that have no tails and
are fully localized on a compact which are achieved when the densities at the
compact edges are in correspondence with zeros of the Bessel function (zero
tunneling condition). Deviations from exact conditions give rise to the
formation of quasi-compactons, e.g. non exact excitations which look as
compactons for any practical purpose, for which the zero tunneling condition is
achieved dynamically thanks to an effective nonlinear dispersive coupling
induced by the scattering length modulation. Stability properties of compactons
and quasi-compactons are investigated by linear analysis and by numerical
integrations of the averaged system, respectively, and results compared with
those from the original (unaveraged) system. In particular, the occurrence od
delocalizing transitions with existence of thresholds in the mean inter-species
scattering length is explicitly demonstrated. Under proper management
conditions, stationary compactons and quasi-compactons are quite stable and
robust excitations that can survive on very long time scale. A parameter design

flow of entanglement spectra in MPOs, are discussed, where logarithmic
entropies (approximately $\ln\beta$) are shown in both spin chains and square
lattice models with gapless towers of states. We also reveal that XTRG can be
employed to accurately simulate the Heisenberg XXZ model on the square lattice
which undergoes a thermal phase transition. We determine its critical
temperature based on thermal physical observables, as well as entanglement
measures. Overall, we demonstrate that XTRG provides an elegant, versatile, and
highly competitive approach to explore thermal properties in both 1D and 2D
quantum lattice models.

paper, in the present one we define paired wreaths. In a paired wreath there is
a monad $B$ and a comonad $F$ over the same 0-cell in a 2-category $\K$, so
that $F$ is a left wreath around $B$ and $B$ is a right cowreath around $F$,
and moreover, $FB$ is a bimonad in $\K$. The corresponding 1-cell $FB$ in the
setting of a biwreath and a biwreath-like object was not necessarilly a
bimonad. We obtain a 2-categorical version of the Radford biproduct and
Sweedler's crossed (co)product, that are on one hand, both a biwreath and a
biwreath-like object, respectively, and on the other hand, they are also paired
wreaths. We show that many known crossed (bi)products in the literature are
special cases of paired wreaths, including cocycle cross product bialgebras of
Bespalov and Drabant in braided monoidal categories. This is a part of a
project of constructing a kind of a 2-categorical atlas of all the known
crossed (bi)products. We introduce a Hopf datum in $\K$ which contains part of
the structure of a paired wreath. We define Yang-Baxter equations and
naturality conditions of certain distributive laws in $\K$ and study when Hopf
data are paired wreaths. From the notion of a Hopf datum new definitions of
Yetter-Drinfel`d modules, (co)module (co)monads, 2-(co)cycles and (co)cycle
twisted (co)actions in a 2-categorical setting are suggested.

flexible accommodating exposures and instrumental variables of arbitrary type,

practice, does not have to be specified in advance. Simulation results with are

electromagnetic momentum density in continuous matter. In our opinion one sees
relatively often that authors over-interpret the importance of their
experimental findings with respect to the momentum problem. Most of these
experiments are actually unable to discriminate between these energy-momentum
tensors at all, since they can be easily described in terms of force
expressions that are common for Abraham and Minkowski. Moreover, we emphasize
the inherent ambiguity in applying formal conservation principles to the
radiation field in a dielectric, the reason being that the electromagnetic
field in matter is only a subsystem which has to be supplemented by the
mechanical subsystem to be closed. Finally, we make some suggestions regarding
the connection between macroscopic electrodynamics and the Casimir effect,
suggesting that there is a limit for the magnitudes of cutoff parameters in QFT

magnetohydrodynamics and passive scalar transport using the quasi-linear
approximation and the spectral $\tau$-approach. We find that compressibility
decreases the $\alpha$ effect and the turbulent magnetic diffusivity both at
small and large magnetic Reynolds numbers, Rm. Similarly, compressibility
decreases the turbulent diffusivity for passive scalars both at small and large
P\'eclet numbers, Pe. On the other hand, compressibility does not affect the
effective pumping velocity of the magnetic field for large Rm, but it decreases
it for small Rm. Density stratification causes turbulent pumping of passive
scalars, but it is found to become weaker with increasing compressibility. No
such pumping effect exists for magnetic fields. However, compressibility
results in a new passive scalar pumping effect from regions of low to high
turbulent intensity both for small and large P\'eclet numbers. It can be
interpreted as compressible turbophoresis of noninertial particles and gaseous
admixtures, while the classical turbophoresis effect exists only for inertial
particles and causes them to be pumped to regions with lower turbulent
intensity.

Around the solstices this curve is approximated by a parabola. In kinematics a

meridian line in the Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli in Rome made by
Francesco Bianchini in 1702 with purpose of measuring the variation of the
obliquity of the ecliptic. The parabola equation is fitted to the data to
obtain the solstice's instant with an accuracy of one hour. The departure of
the measures is within 4 arcsec (the daytime seeing during these solar
transits) from the ephemerides of IMCCE. The pipeline of the algorithm used to
obtain the angular data of the center of the Sun, starting from the ground
measurements affected by the atmospheric refraction, and corrected by the
Cassini equation, is described. Bianchini in 1703 reduced the error on the
solstices timings by using the difference in right ascension between the Sun
and a star observed at the same meridian line even in daytime (as he did with
Sirius in June-July 1703). The present one is an absolute measurement, without
stellar references. The meridian diameter is averagely measured 24 arcsec less
than the true value, with 20 arcsec of standard deviation, because of different
luminosity contrasts in the sky and in the Basilica. Conversely the center of
the image is much better defined (the contrast acts symmetrically without
moving the center of the image), allowing an accuracy to the nearest arcsecond
in the determination of the true obliquity.
