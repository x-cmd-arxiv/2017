fix some (Fermi) energy $\nu>0$, confine fermions with total energy below $\nu$
inside the interval $[-L,L]$ and study the shift of the ground-state energy due

interference has become a key impediment in network performance, thus making
effective interference management (IM) essential to accommodate a rapidly
increasing number of subscribers with diverse services. Although there have
been numerous IM schemes proposed thus far, none of them are free of some form
of cost. It is, therefore, important to balance the benefit brought by and cost
of each adopted IM scheme by adapting its operating parameters to various
network deployments and dynamic channel conditions.
  We propose a novel IM scheme, called dynamic interference steering (DIS), by
recognizing the fact that interference can be not only suppressed or mitigated
but also steered in a particular direction. Specifically, DIS exploits both
channel state information (CSI) and the data contained in the interfering
signal to generate a signal that modifies the spatial feature of the original
interference to partially or fully cancel the interference appearing at the
victim receiver. By intelligently determining the strength of the steering
signal, DIS can steer the interference in an optimal direction to balance the
transmitter's power used for IS and the desired signal's transmission. DIS is
shown via simulation to be able to make better use of the transmit power, hence
enhancing users' spectral efficiency (SE) effectively.

stellar density peaks detected in the star density maps by applying the method

composed from XSTPS-GAC three band images. Then its CMD is checked, in order to
identify whether the central region stars have a clear isochrone-like trend
differing from the background stars. The parameters derived from isochrone
fitting for these candidates are mainly based on three band photometry of
XSTPS-GAC. Meanwhile, when these new candidates are able to be seen clearly on
2MASS, their parameters are also derived based on 2MASS (J-H, J) CMD. Finally,
there are 320 known open clusters rediscovered and 24 new open cluster

characterised by three relevant couplings. Higher-dimensional couplings show
near-Gaussian scaling with increasing canonical mass dimension. We find that

had a workable theory but uncompliant materials. Discovery of superconductivity
of H$_3$S at 200 K in the 160-200 GPa pressure range has renewed anticipation
of yet higher values of the critical temperature T$_c$. With the several

the Galaxy. To study the characteristics of these interesting objects based on
the microlensing method, measurement of the microlens parallax is required to
determine the properties of the lens. Of the various methods to measure
microlens parallax, the most robust way is to make simultaneous ground- and
space-based observations, i.e., by measuring the space-based microlens
parallax. However, space-based campaigns usually require ""expensive"" resources.
Gould & Yee (2012) proposed an idea called the ""cheap space-based microlens
parallax"" that can measure the lens-parallax using only $2$ or $3$ space-based
observations of high-magnification events. This cost-effective observation
strategy to measure microlens parallaxes could be used by space-borne
telescopes to build a complete sample for studying isolated objects. This would
enable a direct measurement of the mass function including both extremely
low-mass objects and high-mass stellar remnants. However, to adopt this idea
requires a test to check how it would work in actual situations. Thus, we
present the first practical test of the idea using the high-magnification
microlensing event OGLE-2016-BLG-1045, for which a subset of Spitzer
observations fortuitously duplicate the prescription of Gould & Yee (2012).
From the test, we confirm that the measurement of the lens-parallax adopting
this idea has sufficient accuracy to determine the physical properties of the
isolated lens.

affine control policies, applied to constrained, discrete-time, partially
observable, linear systems subject to set bounded disturbances, stochastic
noise and potentially Markovian switching over a finite horizon.
  We investigate the situation when performance specifications are expressed
via averaged quadratic inequalities on the random state-control trajectory. Our
methodology also applies to steering the density of the state-control
trajectory under set bounded uncertainty. Our developments are based on
expanding the notion of affine policies that are functions of the so-called
""purified outputs"", to the class of Markov jump linear systems. This
re-parametrization of the set of policies, induces a bi-affine structure in the
state and control variables that can further be exploited via robust
optimization techniques, with the approximate inhomogeneous $S$-lemma being the
cornerstone. Tractability is understood in the sense that for each type of
performance specification considered, an explicit convex program for selecting
the parameters specifying the control policy is provided.
  Our contributions to the existing literature on the subject of robust
constrained control lies in the fact that we are addressing a wider class of
systems than the ones already studied, by including Markovian switching, and
the consideration of quadratic inequalities rather than just linear ones. Our
work expands on the previous investigations on finite horizon covariance
control by addressing the robustness issue and the possibility that the full
state may not be available, therefore enabling the steering of the
state-control trajectory density in the presence of disturbances under partial
observation.

despite large overparametrization and despite the large capacity demonstrated
by zero training error on randomly labeled data. In this note, we show that the
dynamics associated to gradient descent minimization of nonlinear networks is
topologically equivalent, near the asymptotically stable minima of the
empirical error, to linear gradient system in a quadratic potential with a
degenerate (for square loss) or almost degenerate (for logistic or crossentropy
loss) Hessian. The proposition depends on the qualitative theory of dynamical
systems and is supported by numerical results. Our main propositions extend to
deep nonlinear networks two properties of gradient descent for linear networks,
that have been recently established (1) to be key to their generalization
properties: 1. Gradient descent enforces a form of implicit regularization
controlled by the number of iterations, and asymptotically converges to the
minimum norm solution for appropriate initial conditions of gradient descent.
This implies that there is usually an optimum early stopping that avoids
overfitting of the loss. This property, valid for the square loss and many
other loss functions, is relevant especially for regression. 2. For
classification, the asymptotic convergence to the minimum norm solution implies
convergence to the maximum margin solution which guarantees good classification
error for ""low noise"" datasets. This property holds for loss functions such as
the logistic and cross-entropy loss independently of the initial conditions.
The robustness to overparametrization has suggestive implications for the
robustness of the architecture of deep convolutional networks with respect to
the curse of dimensionality.

effect of bulge mass and bulge concentration on bar formation. Bars are global
disk instabilities that evolve by transferring angular momentum from the inner
to outer disks and to the dark matter halo. It is well known that a massive
spherical component such as halo in a disk galaxy can make it bar stable. In
this study we explore the effect of another spherical component, the bulge, on
bar formation in disk galaxies. In our models we vary both the bulge mass and
concentration. We have used two sets of models, one that has a dense bulge and
high surface density disk. The second model has a less concentrated bulge and a
lighter disk. In both models we vary the bulge to disk mass fraction from 0 to
0.7. Simulations of both the models show that there is an upper cutoff in bulge
to disk mass ratio M b /M d above which bars cannot form; the cutoff is smaller
for denser bulges( M b /M d = 0.2) compared to less denser ones (M b /M d =
0.5). We define a new criteria for bar formation in terms of bulge to disk
radial force ratio (F b /F d ) at the disk scale lengths above which bars
cannot form. We find that if F b /F d > 0.35, a disk is stable and a bar cannot
form. Our results indicate that early type disk galaxies can still form strong
bars in spite of having massive bulges.

To balance image acquisition speed and resolution, only 2D images or
low-resolution 3D volumes can be used clinically. In this paper, a real-time
and registration-free framework for dynamic shape instantiation, generalizable
to multiple anatomical applications, is proposed to instantiate high-resolution
3D shapes of an organ from a single 2D image intra-operatively. Firstly, an
approximate optimal scan plane was determined by analyzing the pre-operative 3D
statistical shape model (SSM) of the anatomy with sparse principal component
analysis (SPCA) and considering practical constraints . Secondly, kernel
partial least squares regression (KPLSR) was used to learn the relationship
between the pre-operative 3D SSM and a synchronized 2D SSM constructed from 2D
images obtained at the approximate optimal scan plane. Finally, the derived
relationship was applied to the new intra-operative 2D image obtained at the
same scan plane to predict the high-resolution 3D shape intra-operatively. A
major feature of the proposed framework is that no extra registration between
the pre-operative 3D SSM and the synchronized 2D SSM is required. Detailed
validation was performed on studies including the liver and right ventricle
(RV) of the heart. The derived results (mean accuracy of 2.19mm on patients and
computation speed of 1ms) demonstrate its potential clinical value for
real-time, high-resolution, dynamic and 3D interventional guidance.

for gaze controlled environments and aimed at reducing average KSPC . and
spatial footprint. It also presents an empirical evaluation of this proposed
system by using three different input devices: mouse, gamepad, and eye tracker.
The experiment was conducted using 9 participants and the obtained data were
used to compare the entry speeds, efficiency and KSPC of H4-Writer for all the
devices. Over three blocks, the average entry speed was 3.54 wpm for the mouse,
3.33 wpm for the gamepad and only 2.11 wpm for the eye tracker. While the eye
tracker fared poorly compared to the mouse and the gamepad on entry speed, it
showed significant improvement in entry speed over progressing blocks
indicating increase in entry speed with practice. A full longitudinal study was
conducted to indicate this.
  The average KSPC of all the three devices over all the text phrases entered
was 2.62, which is significantly lower compared to other hand writing
recognizing text entry techniques like EdgeWrite. An analysis of the blocks
revealed improvement in error rate, efficiency and KSPC values with progressing
block numbers as the participants got more acclimatized with the key codes for
corresponding characters.

  using Genetic Algorithm","MTAP, Springer(Minor Revision)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a new texture descriptor named ""Fractional Local Neighborhood
Intensity Pattern"" (FLNIP) has been proposed for content based image retrieval
(CBIR). It is an extension of the Local Neighborhood Intensity Pattern
(LNIP)[1]. FLNIP calculates the relative intensity difference between a
particular pixel and the center pixel of a 3x3 window by considering the
relationship with adjacent neighbors. In this work, the fractional change in
the local neighborhood involving the adjacent neighbors has been calculated
first with respect to one of the eight neighbors of the center pixel of a 3x3
window. Next, the fractional change has been calculated with respect to the
center itself. The two values of fractional change are next compared to
generate a binary bit pattern. Both sign and magnitude information are encoded
in a single descriptor as it deals with the relative change in magnitude in the
adjacent neighborhood i.e., the comparison of the fractional change. The
descriptor is applied on four multi-resolution images -- one being the raw
image and the other three being filtered gaussian images obtained by applying
gaussian filters of different standard deviations on the raw image to signify
the importance of exploring texture information at different resolutions in an
image. The four sets of distances obtained between the query and the target
image are then combined with a genetic algorithm based approach to improve the
retrieval performance by minimizing the distance between similar class images.
The performance of the method has been tested for image retrieval on four
popular databases. The precision and recall values observed on these databases
have been compared with recent state-of-art local patterns. The proposed method
has shown a significant improvement over many other existing methods.

features between any two energy levels or bands in quantum systems. In generic

delay-and-sum, trade the image quality for the high frame rate. Cutting-edge
inverse scattering methods based on compressed sensing (CS) disrupt this
tradeoff via a priori information. They iteratively recover a high-quality
image from only a few sequential pulse-echo measurements or less echo signals,
if (i) a known dictionary of structural building blocks represents the image
almost sparsely, and (ii) their individual pulse echoes, which are predicted by
a linear model, are sufficiently uncorrelated. The exclusive modeling of the
incident waves as steered plane waves or cylindrical waves, however, has so far
limited the convergence speed, the image quality, and the potential to meet
condition (ii). Motivated by the benefits of randomness in CS, a novel method
for the fast compressed acquisition and the subsequent recovery of images is
proposed to overcome these limitations. It recovers the spatial compressibility
fluctuations in weakly-scattering soft tissue structures, where an orthonormal
basis meets condition (i), by a sparsity-promoting $\ell_{q}$-minimization
method, $q \in [0; 1]$. A realistic $d$-dimensional model, $d \in \{2, 3\}$,
accounting for diffraction, single monopole scattering, the combination of
power-law absorption and dispersion, and the specifications of a planar
transducer array, predicts the pulse echoes of the individual basis functions.
Three innovative types of incident waves, whose syntheses leverage random
apodization weights, time delays, or combinations thereof, aid in meeting
condition (ii). In two-dimensional numerical simulations, single realizations
of these waves outperform the prevalent quasi-plane wave for both the canonical
and the Fourier bases. They significantly reduce the full extents at half
maximum of the point spread functions by up to 73.7 %.

understand when and how distributions exhibit Benford behavior. Most of the
previous work has been restricted to cases of independent variables, and little

develop a method for approximating the Benford behavior of a product of $n$

investigate the Benford behavior of various copulas under varying dependence

convergence to Benford behavior seen with independent random variables as the
number of variables in the product increases is not necessarily preserved when
the variables are dependent and modeled by a copula. Furthermore, there is
strong indication that the preservation of Benford behavior of the product of

sense of transformation optics. For a probe light close to the analogue string,
the flight time variance is $\nu$ times that in a normal homogeneous and
isotropic medium, where $\nu$ is a parameter characterizing the deficit angle

propose a transfer learning-based method to extract imaging features from US
kidney images in order to improve the CAKUT diagnosis in children.
Particularly, a pre-trained deep learning model (imagenet-caffe-alex) is
adopted for transfer learning-based feature extraction from 3-channel feature
maps computed from US images, including original images, gradient features, and
distanced transform features. Support vector machine classifiers are then built
upon different sets of features, including the transfer learning features,
conventional imaging features, and their combination. Experimental results have
demonstrated that the combination of transfer learning features and
conventional imaging features yielded the best classification performance for
distinguishing CAKUT patients from normal controls based on their US kidney
images.

SNe Ia are caused by the explosion of hybrid carbon-oxygen-neon white dwarfs
(CONe WDs) in single-degenerate systems, where SNe Ia-CSM explode in systems
with a massive common envelope (CE) of $\sim1~M_{\odot}$, while SN 2002cx-like
events correspond to those events where most of the CE has been lost in a wind.
Using binary-population-synthesis (BPS) calculations, we estimate a number
ratio of SNe Ia-CSM to SN 2002cx-like objects between $\frac{1}{3}$ and
$\frac{2}{3}$, consistent with observational constraints, and an overall
contribution from hybrid CONe WDs to the total SN Ia population that also
matches the observed number from these peculiar objects. Our model predicts a
statistical sequence of CSM density from SN Ia-CSM to SN 2002cx-like events and
normal SNe Ia, consistent with existing radio constraints. We also find a new
subclass of hybrid SNe which share the properties of Type II and Type Ia SNe,
consistent with some observed SNe, which do not have a surviving companion. In
some cases these could even produce SNe Ia from apparently single WDs.

geographical areas, such as cities or states, from the Internet. Orchestrated
in multiple phases, the attack uses a massively distributed botnet to generate
low-rate benign traffic aiming to congest selected network links, so-called
target links. The adoption of benign traffic, while simultaneously targeting
multiple network links, makes the detection of the Crossfire attack a serious
challenge. In this paper, we propose a framework for early detection of
Crossfire attack, i.e., detection in the warm-up period of the attack. We
propose to monitor traffic at the potential decoy servers and discuss the
advantages comparing with other monitoring approaches. Since the low-rate
attack traffic is very difficult to distinguish from the background traffic, we
investigate several deep learning methods to mine the spatiotemporal features
for attack detection. We investigate Autoencoder, Convolutional Neural Network

the Bayesian exponentially tilted empirical likelihood (BETEL) method,
justified by the fact that an empirical likelihood (EL) can be interpreted as
the nonparametric limit of a Bayesian procedure when the implied probabilities
are obtained from maximizing entropy subject to some given moment constraints.
Considering the impact that outliers are thought to have on the estimation of
population moments, we develop a new robust BETEL (RBETEL) inferential
methodology to deal with this potential problem. We show how the BETEL methods
are linked to the recent work of Bissiri, Holmes and Walker (2016) who propose
a general framework to update prior belief via a loss function. A controlled
simulation experiment is conducted to investigate the performance of the RBETEL
method. We find that the proposed methodology produces reliable posterior
inference for the fundamental relationships that are embedded in the majority
of the data, even when outliers are present. The method is also illustrated in
an empirical study relating brain weight to body weight using a dataset

together with a fully GPU-accelerated multigrid preconditioner which is
designed to minimize memory requirements and to increase overall performance. A
semi-Lagrangian subcycling advection algorithm is used to shift the
computational load per timestep away from the pressure Poisson solve by
allowing larger timestep sizes in exchange for an increased number of advection
steps. Numerical results confirm we achieve the design order accuracy in time

tuning the fine-grain parallelism, memory utilization, and maximizing
bandwidth. To assess overall performance we present an empirically calibrated
roofline performance model for a target GPU to explain the achieved efficiency.
We demonstrate that, in the most cases, the kernels used in the solver are
close to their empirically predicted roofline performance.

development. This process of 'fetal programming' is mediated by the effects of
the prenatal experience on the developing hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)
axis and autonomic nervous system (ANS). The HPA axis is a dynamic system
regulating homeostasis, especially the stress response, and is highly sensitive
to adverse early life experiences. We review the evidence for the effects of PS
on fetal programming of the HPA axis and the ANS. We derive a multi-scale
multi-species approach to devising preclinical and clinical studies to identify
early non-invasively available pre- and postnatal biomarkers of these
programming effects. Such approach would identify adverse postnatal brain
developmental trajectories, a prerequisite for designing therapeutic
interventions. The multiple scales include the biomarkers reflecting changes in
the brain epigenome, metabolome, microbiome and the ANS activity gauged via an
array of advanced non-invasively obtainable properties of fetal heart rate
fluctuations. The proposed framework has the potential to reveal mechanistic
links between maternal stress during pregnancy and changes across these
physiological scales. Such biomarkers may hence be useful as early and
non-invasive predictors of neurodevelopmental trajectories influenced by the
PS. We conclude that studies into PS effects must be conducted on multiple
scales derived from concerted observations in multiple animal models and human
cohorts performed in an interactive and iterative manner and deploying machine
learning for data synthesis, identification and validation of the best
non-invasive biomarkers.

practical applications. In this paper, we introduces a flexible first-order
primal-dual algorithm called the Variant Auxiliary Problem Principle (VAPP) for
solving NCCP problems when the objective function and constraints are smooth
and may be nonsmooth. Each iteration of VAPP generates a nonlinear
approximation to the primal problem of an augmented Lagrangian method. The
approximation incorporates both linearization and a variable distance-like
function, and then the iterations of VAPP provide one decomposition property
for NCCP. Motivated by recent applications in big data analysis, there has been
an explosive growth in interest in the convergence rate analysis of parallel
computing algorithms for large scale optimization problem. This paper proposes
an iteration-based error bound and linear convergence of VAPP. Some verifiable
sufficient conditions of this error bound are also discussed. For the general
convex case (without error bound), we establish $O(1/t)$ convergence rate for
primal suboptimality, feasibility and dual suboptimality. By adaptively setting
in parameters at different iterations, we show an $O(1/t^2)$ rate for the

method, that can accurately segment objects with only a handful of clicks. On
the GrabCut dataset, our method obtains 90% IOU with just 3.8 clicks on

iteratively refines an initial segmentation, it can effectively correct frames
where the video object segmentation fails, thus allowing users to quickly
obtain high quality results even on challenging sequences. Finally, we
investigate usage patterns and give insights in how many steps users take to
annotate frames, what kind of corrections they provide, etc., thus giving

approach is a relatively new and dynamic field towards the quantum gravity
phenomenology, which emerges from the symmetric sector of the loop quantum

to find a new and tighter bound on the polymer deformation parameter. Our

embedding the minimal length into the standard canonical commutation relation.
We extend this scheme to probe the \emph{polymer length} deformed canonical
commutation relation of the center of mass mode of a mechanical oscillator with
a mass around the Planck scale. The method utilizes the novelty of exchanging
the relevant mechanical information with a high intensity optical pulse inside
an optical cavity. We also demonstrate that our proposal is within the reach of
the current technologies and, thus, it could uncover a decent realization of
quantum gravitational phenomena thorough a simple table-top experiment.

catalogue. To demonstrate the power of investigative capabilities of the $WG_M$
method, in terms of flare and CME eruptions, we studied two typical ARs,
namely, AR 12158 and AR 12192. The choice of ARs represent canonical cases. AR
12158 produced an X1.6 flare with fast ""halo"" CME ($v_{linear}$=1267 $km
s^{-1}$) while in AR 12192 there occurred a range of powerful X-class
eruptions, i.e. X1.1, X1.6, X3.1, X1.0, X2.0 and X2.0-class energetic flares,
interestingly, none with an accompanying CME. The value itself and temporal
variation of $WG_{M}$ is found to possess potentially important diagnostic
information about the intensity of the expected flare class. Furthermore, we
have also estimated the flare onset time from the relationship of duration of
converging and diverging motions of the area-weighted barycenters of two
subgroups of opposite magnetic polarities. This test turns out not only to
provide information about the intensity of the expected flare-class and the
flare onset time but may also indicate whether a flare will occur with/without
fast CME.
  We have also found that, in the case when the negative polarity barycenter
has moved around and the positive one ""remained"" at the same coordinates
preceding eruption, the flare occurred with fast ""halo"" CME.
  Otherwise, when both the negative and the positive polarity barycenters have
moved around, the AR produced flares without CME. If these properties found for
the movement of the barycenters are generic pre-cursors of CME eruption (or
lack of it), identifying them may serve as an excellent pre-condition for
refining the forecast of the lift-off of CMEs.

the combination of conductance and shot noise measurements, we investigate
blocking states in carbon nanotube (CNT) QDs. We report negative differential
conductance and super-Poissonian noise. The enhanced noise is the signature of
electron bunching, which originates from random switches between the strongly

appears here when the blocking state is an excited state. In this case, at the

$P$, then $\dim(P)\le \max\{2,d\}$; also if $\dim(B)\le d$ for every block $B$
of a poset $P$, then $\dim(P)\le d+2$. By way of constrast, local dimension is
well behaved with respect to components, but not for blocks: if
$\text{ldim}(C)\le d$ for every component $C$ of a poset $P$, then
$\text{ldim}(P)\le d+2$; however, for every $d\ge 4$, there exists a poset $P$
with $\text{ldim}(P)=d$ and $\dim(B)\le 3$ for every block $B$ of $P$. In this
paper we show that Boolean dimension behaves like Dushnik-Miller dimension with
respect to both components and blocks: if $\text{bdim}(C)\le d$ for every
component $C$ of $P$, then $\text{bdim}(P)\le 2+d+4\cdot2^d$; also if
$\text{bdim}(B)\le d$ for every block of $P$, then $\text{bdim}(P)\le
19+d+18\cdot 2^d$.

the missing area is relatively large. However, most of the existing inpainting
networks introduce undesired artifacts and noise to the repaired regions. To
solve this problem, we present a novel framework which consists of two stacked
convolutional neural networks that inpaint the image and remove the artifacts,
respectively. The first network considers the global structure of the damaged
image and coarsely fills the blank area. Then the second network modifies the
repaired image to cancel the noise introduced by the first network. The
proposed framework splits the problem into two distinct partitions that can be
optimized separately, therefore it can be applied to any inpainting algorithm
by changing the first network. Second stage in our framework which aims at
polishing the inpainted images can be treated as a denoising problem where a
wide range of algorithms can be employed. Our results demonstrate that the
proposed framework achieves significant improvement on both visual and
quantitative evaluations.

tight-binding electron motion in the presence of periodic potential with a
period incommensurate with lattice constant. This model is known to exhibit an
insulator-metal transition upon increasing the hopping amplitude. Without
external magnetic field, spin-orbit coupling leads to a simple renormalization
of the hopping amplitude. However, when the degeneracy of the on-site energies
is lifted by an external magnetic field, the interplay of Zeeman splitting and
spin-orbit coupling has a strong effect on the localization length. We studied
this interplay numerically by calculating the energy dependence of the Lyapunov
exponent in the insulating regime. Numerical results can be unambiguously
interpreted in the language of the phase-space trajectories. As a first step,
we have explained the plateau in the energy dependence of the localization
length in the original Aubry-Andre model. Our main finding is that a very weak
spin-orbit coupling leads to delocalization of states with energies smaller
than the Zeeman shift. The origin of the effect is the spin-orbit-induced
opening of new transport channels. We have also found that restructuring of the

localization length.

  Markovian Protocols","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1709.09123",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We address the problem of simulating an arbitrary binary interactive
first-order Markovian protocol over a pair of binary symmetric channels with
crossover probability $\varepsilon$. We are interested in the achievable rates
of reliable simulation, i.e., in characterizing the smallest possible blowup in
communications such that a vanishing error probability (in the protocol length)
can be attained. Whereas for general interactive protocols the output of each
party may depend on all previous outputs of its counterpart, in a (first-order)
Markovian protocol this dependence is limited to the last observed output only.
Previous works in the field discuss broader families of protocols but assess
the achievable rates only at the limit where $\varepsilon\to0$.
  In this paper, we prove that the one-way Shannon capacity,
$1-h(\varepsilon)$, can be achieved for any binary first-order Markovian
protocol. This surprising result, is to the best of our knowledge, the first
example in which non-trivial interactive protocol can be simulated in the
Shannon capacity. We give two capacity achieving coding schemes, which both
divide the protocol into independent blocks, and implement vertical block
coding. The first scheme is based on a random separation into blocks with
variable lengths. The second scheme is based on a deterministic separation into
blocks, and efficiently predicting their last transmission. The prediction can
be regarded as a binary pointer jumping game, for which we show that the final
step can be calculated with $O(\log m)$ bits, where $m$ is the number of rounds
in the game. We conclude the work by discussing possible extensions of the
result to higher order models.

swimming microorganisms is strongly altered by the presence of nearby
boundaries in a viscous flow. Using a simple model three-linked sphere swimmer,
we show that the swimming trajectories near a no-slip wall reveal various
scenarios of motion depending on the initial orientation and the distance
separating the swimmer from the wall. We find that the swimmer can either be
trapped by the wall, completely escape, or perform an oscillatory gliding
motion at a constant mean height above the wall. Using a far-field
approximation, we find that, at leading order, the wall-induced correction has
a source-dipolar or quadrupolar flow structure where the translational and
angular velocities of the swimmer decay as inverse third and fourth powers with
distance from the wall, respectively. The resulting equations of motion for the
trajectories and the relevant order parameters fully characterize the
transition between the states and allow for an accurate description of the
swimming behavior near a wall. We demonstrate that the transition between the
trapping and oscillatory gliding states is first order discontinuous, whereas
the transition between the trapping and escaping states is continuous,
characterized by non-trivial scaling exponents of the order parameters. In
order to model the circular motion of flagellated bacteria near solid
interfaces, we further assume that the spheres can undergo rotational motion
around the swimming axis. We show that the general three-dimensional motion can
be mapped onto a quasi-two-dimensional representational model by an appropriate
redefinition of the order parameters governing the transition between the
swimming states.

neutron star. The shock wave is expected to possess enough strength to ignite
the nuclear matter thereby converting it to quark matter. The conversion of
nuclear to quark matter is assumed to take place at the shock discontinuity.
The density and pressure discontinuity is studied both spatially and temporally
as it starts near the center of the star and moves towards the surface.
Polytropic equations of state which mimics real original nuclear matter and
quark matter equations of state are used to study such dynamical phase
transition. Solving relativistic hydrodynamic equations for a spherically
symmetric star we have studied the phase transition assuming a considerable
density discontinuity near the center. We find that as the shock wave
propagates outwards, its intensity decreases with time, however the shock
velocity peaks up and reaches a value close to that of light. Such fast shock
velocity indicates rapid phase transition in neutron star taking place on a
timescale of some tens of microseconds. Such a result is quite an interesting
one, and it differs from previous calculations that the phase transition in
neutron stars takes at least some tens of milliseconds. Rapid phase transition
can have significant observational significance because such fast phase
transition would imply quite strong gravitational wave signals but very short
lived. Such short-lived gravitational wave signals would be accompanied with
short-lived gamma-ray bursts and neutrino signals originating from the neutrino
and gamma-ray generation from the phase transition of nuclear matter to quark
matter.
